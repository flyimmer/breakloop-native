# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Native Module Development

**BEFORE creating or modifying ANY native module, READ:**
- `docs/AI_ASSISTANT_RULES.md` - Complete mandatory checklist
- `NATIVE_MODULE_CHECKLIST.md` - Quick reference
- `.cursor/rules/native-modules.mdc` - Cursor-specific rules

**Key Rule:** When adding native modules, you MUST:
1. Update plugin to copy files
2. Update plugin to register package
3. Update validation script
4. Run `npm run validate:native` (MUST PASS)

**Validation is mandatory** - if `npm run validate:native` fails, the module won't work.

### Native Code Verification Protocol (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE modifying ANY Kotlin file, READ THIS:**

Every Kotlin change MUST follow this verification protocol. Skipping steps causes silent failures that waste hours.

**The 10-Step Verification Process:**

1. **Edit** Kotlin file in `plugins/src/android/java/`
2. **Verify source** - Check your changes are in the file you edited
3. **Sync** - Run `npm run sync:kotlin`
4. **Verify sync** - Diff source and synced files (must be identical)
5. **Clean** - Run `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`
6. **Build** - Run `npm run android`
7. **Verify build** - Check logs show `:app:compileDebugKotlin` (not UP-TO-DATE)
8. **Verify APK** - Check APK timestamp is recent
9. **Test** - Open relevant screen in app
10. **Verify logs** - Native logs must appear within 5 seconds

**If ANY verification step fails, STOP and fix it before continuing.**

**Common Silent Failures:**
- Sync says "Already up to date" but you just made changes → Force re-sync
- Build shows `:app:compileDebugKotlin UP-TO-DATE` → Delete `kotlin-classes` directory, then `./gradlew clean`
- No native logs appear → Code isn't in APK, delete `kotlin-classes` and rebuild from step 1
- Compiled class timestamp older than source → `./gradlew clean` didn't work, delete `kotlin-classes` manually

**Red Flag Commands:**
- ❌ `npm run sync:kotlin` alone (no verification)
- ❌ `npm run android` without deleting `kotlin-classes` and `./gradlew clean` first
- ❌ `./gradlew clean` alone (doesn't delete compiled Kotlin classes!)
- ❌ Assuming build worked because it succeeded

**Correct Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Edit file in plugins/src/android/java/
# 2. Verify changes in source file
Select-String -Path "plugins/src/android/java/.../AppMonitorModule.kt" -Pattern "YOUR_CHANGE"

# 3. Sync
npm run sync:kotlin

# 4. Verify sync worked (files must be identical)
$source = Get-Content "plugins/src/android/java/.../AppMonitorModule.kt" -Raw
$synced = Get-Content "android/app/src/main/java/.../AppMonitorModule.kt" -Raw
if ($source -ne $synced) { Write-Host "SYNC FAILED!" }

# 5. Clean (MANDATORY) - Delete Kotlin compiled classes first!
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force android\app\build\tmp\kotlin-classes -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force android\app\build\intermediates\classes -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

# 6. Build
npm run android

# 7. Test immediately - logs must appear
adb logcat -c
adb logcat -s AppMonitorModule:*
```

See `spec/development_workflow_guide_c213276d.plan.md` for complete verification protocol.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start Expo development server
npm start
# or
expo start

# Run on specific platform
npm run android    # Start Android emulator/device (auto-syncs Kotlin files)
npm run ios        # Start iOS simulator/device
npm run web        # Start web version (Expo web)

# Kotlin file management
npm run sync:kotlin      # Manually sync Kotlin files from plugins/ to android/
npm run validate:kotlin  # Verify all Kotlin files are registered in plugin

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

### Kotlin File Workflow (CRITICAL)

**BEFORE editing ANY `.kt` file, ALWAYS check the file path:**

❌ **WRONG - Never edit these:**
- `android/app/src/main/java/.../*.kt`
- These files are AUTO-GENERATED by Expo and will be OVERWRITTEN

✅ **CORRECT - Always edit these:**
- `plugins/src/android/java/.../*.kt`
- These are the SOURCE OF TRUTH

**Standard Workflow (Editing Existing Files):**
```bash
# 1. Edit Kotlin file in plugins/src/android/java/com/anonymous/breakloopnative/
# 2. Run the app (auto-syncs and builds)
npm run android
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: First Time / Native Module Registration Issues**

If native logs don't appear or you get "Native module not found":

```bash
# 1. Check if module is registered
grep "AppMonitorPackage" android/app/src/main/java/com/anonymous/breakloopnative/MainApplication.kt

# 2. If NOT found, run prebuild to register the module
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean
npm run android
```

**When to use `expo prebuild`:**
- ✅ First time building project / after cloning
- ✅ Adding NEW Kotlin files (not just editing existing ones)
- ✅ Native module not registered (module not found errors)
- ✅ Changing AndroidManifest.xml structure
- ✅ Modifying plugin configuration
- ❌ NOT needed for editing existing Kotlin files (if module already registered)

**Diagnostic: If native logs don't appear after `npm run android`:**
1. Check if `AppMonitorPackage` is in `MainApplication.kt` (see command above)
2. If missing → Run `npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean`
3. If present → Uninstall app completely: `adb uninstall com.anonymous.breakloopnative`, then `npm run android`

See `docs/KOTLIN_FILE_SYNC.md` for complete workflow documentation.

## Project Overview

**BreakLoop** is a React Native (Expo) mobile application that helps users break mindless scrolling habits through mindful interventions, alternative activity suggestions, and community accountability features. The codebase includes both a React Native mobile app and shared core business logic that can be reused across platforms.

## Design Documentation

This project includes comprehensive design documentation that serves as the source of truth for UI/UX implementation:

**State Management & Flows:**
- `design/ux/states.md` - Complete UI state definitions, transitions, triggers, and edge cases (997 lines)
- `design/ux/flows.md` - Detailed user flow documentation with 14 major flows covering all user journeys

**Design System:**
- `design/ui/components.md` - Component library specification with all reusable UI components
- `design/ui/screens.md` - Complete screen inventory (38 screens organized by category)
- `design/ui/tokens.md` - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, elevation, motion)
- `design/ui/tone-ambient-hearth.md` - Design tone/philosophy ("Ambient Hearth" aesthetic)

**Design Principles:**

**When implementing features:**
- Reference `states.md` for state management and transitions
- Reference `flows.md` for user journey sequences
- Reference `components.md` and `screens.md` for UI structure
- Follow `tone-ambient-hearth.md` and `tokens.md` for styling consistency

## High-Level Architecture

### System Surface Architecture (Critical)

**IMPORTANT:** BreakLoop uses a three-runtime architecture with System Brain JS as the semantic decision-maker.

**Core Concepts:**

**1. Runtime Context** - Determines which JavaScript runtime is active:
- `SYSTEM_BRAIN` - Event-driven headless runtime for semantic logic (NEW)
- `SYSTEM_SURFACE` - OS-level overlay for interventions (SystemSurfaceActivity, conceptually named, currently `InterventionActivity`)
- `MAIN_APP` - Normal app launched by user (MainActivity)

**2. System Brain JS** - Event-driven, headless JavaScript runtime:
- Runs as React Native Headless JS task
- Receives MECHANICAL events from native ("TIMER_EXPIRED", "FOREGROUND_CHANGED")
- Classifies semantic meaning (Quick Task vs Intention)
- Evaluates OS Trigger Brain logic
- Decides when to launch SystemSurface
- Loads/saves state on each event invocation
- Does NOT run continuously or maintain in-memory state

**3. System Session** - Defines whether SystemSurfaceActivity has a legitimate reason to exist:
```typescript
type SystemSession =
  | { kind: 'INTERVENTION'; app: AppId }
  | { kind: 'QUICK_TASK'; app: AppId }
  | { kind: 'ALTERNATIVE_ACTIVITY'; app: AppId }
  | null;
```

**Invariant:** `SystemSurfaceActivity.isAlive === (SystemSession !== null)`

**4. Bootstrap State** - Protects cold start lifecycle:
```typescript
type SessionBootstrapState = 'BOOTSTRAPPING' | 'READY';
```

**Critical Bootstrap Rule:**
> SystemSurfaceActivity must survive long enough for JavaScript to decide whether a SystemSession exists.

During cold start, `session === null` means "decision not made yet", NOT "finish immediately".

**SystemSurfaceRoot Logic:**
```tsx
function SystemSurfaceRoot() {
  const { session, bootstrapState } = useSystemSession();

  if (bootstrapState === 'BOOTSTRAPPING') {
    // Cold start phase — NEVER finish here
    return null;
  }

  if (session === null) {
    // Decision complete, no session needed
    finishSystemSurfaceActivity();
    return null;
  }

  // Render appropriate flow based on session.kind
  switch (session.kind) {
    case 'INTERVENTION': return <InterventionFlow />;
    case 'QUICK_TASK': return <QuickTaskFlow />;
    case 'ALTERNATIVE_ACTIVITY': return <AlternativeActivityFlow />;
  }
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ THREE JavaScript runtimes (System Brain, SystemSurface, MainApp)
- ✅ System Brain is event-driven, headless, semantic logic
- ✅ Native emits MECHANICAL events, System Brain classifies SEMANTIC meaning
- ✅ ONE shared OS-level activity (System Surface)
- ✅ THREE distinct states (BOOTSTRAPPING, ACTIVE SESSION, NO SESSION)
- ✅ Multiple separate, mutually exclusive flows
- ✅ Only ONE flow active at any time
- ✅ Main app UI NEVER appears in System Surface
- ✅ Each context has separate React Native instances and separate state

See `docs/SYSTEM_SURFACE_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/SYSTEM_BRAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete architecture documentation.

### Native–JavaScript Boundary (Critical)

**IMPORTANT:** All code changes must respect the architectural boundary defined in `docs/NATIVE_JAVASCRIPT_BOUNDARY.md`.

**Core Principle:**
- **Native code (Kotlin) emits MECHANICAL events** (what happened)
- **System Brain JS classifies SEMANTIC meaning** (what it means)
- **SystemSurface JS renders UI** (what user sees)

**Key Rules:**
- Native code: Detects events, persists timestamps, emits mechanical events ("TIMER_EXPIRED", "FOREGROUND_CHANGED")
- System Brain JS: Receives mechanical events, classifies semantic meaning (Quick Task vs Intention), evaluates OS Trigger Brain, decides when to launch SystemSurface
- SystemSurface JS: Renders intervention screens, handles user input, reports decisions to System Brain
- Never duplicate logic across boundaries
- System Brain loads/saves state on each event invocation (event-driven, not continuous)

**Wake Reason Contract (Phase 2 - Explicit Pre-Decision):**
- Native emits mechanical events to System Brain JS ("TIMER_EXPIRED", "FOREGROUND_CHANGED")
- System Brain classifies semantic meaning and evaluates OS Trigger Brain priority chain
- System Brain pre-decides UI flow and launches SystemSurface with **explicit wake reason**
- System Brain passes wake reason to SystemSurface:
  - `SHOW_QUICK_TASK_DIALOG` - System Brain decided to show Quick Task dialog
  - `START_INTERVENTION_FLOW` - System Brain decided to start Intervention flow
  - `QUICK_TASK_EXPIRED_FOREGROUND` - Quick Task expired, show Intervention
  - `DEV_DEBUG` - Debug/testing wake
- SystemSurface reads wake reason and **directly dispatches session** (no logic, no re-evaluation)

**Red Flags (Immediate Failure):**
- ❌ Kotlin code checks `n_quickTask`
- ❌ Kotlin code chooses Quick Task vs Intervention
- ❌ Kotlin code decides navigation or screens
- ❌ Kotlin code labels events with semantic meaning
- ❌ System Brain JS skips priority chain based on native assumptions
- ❌ SystemSurface JS uses setTimeout for semantic timers
- ❌ `QUICK_TASK_EXPIRED_FOREGROUND` triggers Quick Task dialog again
- ❌ Main app UI appears in System Surface
- ❌ Native logic duplicates JS logic
- ❌ Semantic logic in SystemSurface or MainApp contexts

See `docs/NATIVE_JAVASCRIPT_BOUNDARY.md` and `docs/SYSTEM_BRAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete boundary rules and verification checklist.

### OS Trigger Priority Chain (LOCKED)

This order is **AUTHORITATIVE** and must never change:

```
1. Quick Task ACTIVE (per-app: t_quickTask)
   → Suppress everything for this app

2. Alternative Activity RUNNING (per-app)
   → Suppress everything for this app

3. t_intention VALID (per-app)
   → Suppress everything for this app
   → Quick Task dialog MUST NOT appear

4. n_quickTask > 0 (global usage count)
   → Show Quick Task dialog

5. Else
   → Start Intervention Flow
```

**Important Distinctions:**
- **t_quickTask** (timer): PER-APP - Each app has its own independent Quick Task timer
- **n_quickTask** (usage count): GLOBAL - Shared quota across all monitored apps
- **t_intention** (timer): PER-APP - Each app has its own intention timer

**Monitored Apps:**
- Each individual monitored app/website has its own timers/parameters
- **Exception:** `n_quickTask` is global across all monitored apps
- Every time a monitored app enters foreground, OS trigger logic evaluates whether intervention should start

See `docs/OS_Trigger_Contract V1.md` for complete trigger rules and timer logic.

### React Native (Expo) Application

**Platform:** React Native with Expo SDK (~54.0.30)
**Navigation:** React Navigation v7 (Stack Navigator + Bottom Tabs)
**State Management:** React Context + useReducer for intervention state
**UI Library:** Lucide React Native for icons

### Architecture Overview

**Three-Runtime Architecture:**

BreakLoop uses THREE separate JavaScript runtimes:

1. **System Brain JS** (Event-Driven Headless Runtime)
   - Runs as React Native Headless JS task
   - Event-driven, not continuously running
   - Receives MECHANICAL events from native ("TIMER_EXPIRED", "FOREGROUND_CHANGED")
   - Classifies semantic meaning (Quick Task vs Intention)
   - Evaluates OS Trigger Brain logic
   - Decides when to launch SystemSurface
   - Loads/saves state on each event invocation
   - NEVER renders UI
   - Single source of semantic truth

2. **System Surface Context** (`InterventionActivity`, conceptually `SystemSurfaceActivity`)
   - OS-level overlay that appears on top of other apps
   - Ephemeral, created on-demand and destroyed after use
   - Renders ONE of three flows: Quick Task, Intervention, or Alternative Activity
   - Receives wake reason from System Brain JS
   - Manages bootstrap lifecycle (BOOTSTRAPPING → READY)
   - Finishes itself when session is null and bootstrap is READY
   - UI-only, NO semantic logic or setTimeout timers

3. **Main App Context** (`MainActivity`)
   - Normal app launched by user from home screen
   - Persistent, stays alive in background
   - Bottom tabs: Insights, Community, Inbox, Settings
   - Uses React Navigation for in-app navigation
   - NEVER creates SystemSession or runs OS Trigger Brain
   - User features only (settings, community)

**Navigation Architecture:**

- **Root Navigator** (`app/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`): Stack navigator managing main tabs and intervention flow screens
- **Main Navigation** (`app/navigation/MainNavigation.tsx`): Bottom tab navigator for main app sections (Insights, Community, Inbox, Settings)
- **Community Stack** (`app/navigation/CommunityStackNavigator.tsx`): Stack navigator for community sub-screens
- **Intervention Screens**: Modal-style screens for the intervention flow (breathing → root-cause → alternatives → action → reflection)

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ THREE separate JavaScript runtimes (System Brain, SystemSurface, MainApp)
- ✅ System Brain is event-driven, headless, semantic logic
- ✅ System Brain receives mechanical events, classifies semantic meaning
- ✅ System Brain evaluates OS Trigger Brain logic
- ✅ SystemSurface is ephemeral, UI-only, no semantic timers
- ✅ MainApp is persistent, user features only
- ✅ Separate state, separate contexts, separate lifecycles
- ✅ Only System Brain runs OS Trigger Brain
- ✅ Only System Brain creates SystemSession
- ✅ Main App NEVER appears in System Surface

**Note:** The core intervention business logic is framework-agnostic and shared between web and mobile implementations. UI components and navigation are React Native-specific.

### Framework-Agnostic Core Logic
The intervention state machine has been extracted into `src/core/intervention/` as pure JavaScript functions with no React dependencies. This allows the same business logic to be reused in React Native or other frameworks. See [Intervention State Machine](#intervention-state-machine) section below.

### System Brain JS

**Location:** `src/systemBrain/` (NEW)

System Brain JS is an **event-driven, headless JavaScript runtime** that runs as a React Native Headless JS task. It is the single source of semantic truth for intervention decisions.

**Lifecycle:**
- Invoked by native when mechanical events occur
- Loads state from persistent storage on each invocation
- Recomputes state deterministically
- Saves state to persistent storage after processing
- Does NOT run continuously or maintain in-memory state

**Responsibilities (Phase 2 - Explicit Pre-Decision):**
- Receive MECHANICAL events from native ("TIMER_EXPIRED", "FOREGROUND_CHANGED")
- Classify semantic meaning (Quick Task vs Intention)
- **Evaluate OS Trigger Brain priority chain**
- **Pre-decide UI flow** (Quick Task OR Intervention)
- Launch SystemSurface with **explicit wake reason** (`SHOW_QUICK_TASK_DIALOG` or `START_INTERVENTION_FLOW`)
- Maintain semantic state (t_quickTask, t_intention)
- Persist/restore state on each invocation

**Event Classification & Pre-Decision:**
- Native emits: "FOREGROUND_CHANGED for app X at timestamp Y"
- System Brain classifies: "Is this a monitored app?"
- System Brain evaluates: "Check t_intention, t_quickTask, n_quickTask"
- System Brain pre-decides: "SHOW_QUICK_TASK or START_INTERVENTION"
- System Brain launches SystemSurface with explicit wake reason

**Integration:**
- Registered as React Native Headless JS task in `index.js`
- Receives events from ForegroundDetectionService
- Evaluates OS Trigger Brain priority chain
- Launches SystemSurface via AppMonitorModule with explicit wake reason
- SystemSurface directly dispatches based on wake reason (no re-evaluation)

### OS Trigger Brain

**Location:** `src/os/osTriggerBrain.ts`

The OS Trigger Brain logic is now invoked by System Brain JS (not directly by SystemSurface).

**Priority Chain (LOCKED ORDER):**
1. Quick Task ACTIVE (per-app: t_quickTask) → Suppress
2. Alternative Activity RUNNING (per-app) → Suppress
3. t_intention VALID (per-app) → Suppress
4. n_quickTask > 0 (global usage count) → Show Quick Task dialog
5. Else → Start Intervention Flow

**Integration:**
- Called by System Brain JS event handler
- Evaluates priority chain based on current state
- Returns decision to System Brain
- System Brain launches SystemSurface if needed

### Native Module Integration

**Location:** `src/native-modules/AppMonitorModule.ts`

TypeScript interface for native Kotlin modules. Provides bridge between JavaScript and native code.

**Key Functions:**
- `getWakeReason()` - Read wake reason from native (SHOW_QUICK_TASK_DIALOG, START_INTERVENTION_FLOW, etc.)
- `getTriggeringApp()` - Read which app triggered the wake
- `getQuickTaskStatus()` - Check if Quick Task is active for an app
- `getIntentionTimerStatus()` - Check if intention timer is valid for an app
- `startQuickTask(appId, duration)` - Start Quick Task timer in native
- `setIntentionTimer(appId, duration)` - Set intention timer in native
- `finishSystemSurfaceActivity()` - Close System Surface and return to previous app

**Native Implementation:**
- `plugins/src/android/java/.../AppMonitorModule.kt` - Native module implementation (includes `launchSystemSurface()`)
- `plugins/src/android/java/.../ForegroundDetectionService.kt` - Accessibility service for app detection (emits mechanical events)
- `plugins/src/android/java/.../InterventionActivity.kt` - System Surface Activity

**System Brain Implementation:**
- `src/systemBrain/index.ts` - Registers headless task
- `src/systemBrain/eventHandler.ts` - Event classification and decisions
- `src/systemBrain/stateManager.ts` - State persistence
- `src/systemBrain/nativeBridge.ts` - Native communication

### Intervention State Machine

**Location:** `src/core/intervention/` (framework-agnostic)

The intervention flow state machine has been extracted into pure JavaScript functions with no React dependencies. This allows the same business logic to be reused in React Native or other frameworks.

**Architecture:**
- **State-driven**: Uses a reducer pattern with immutable state updates
- **Pure functions**: All transitions are predictable and testable
- **Framework-agnostic**: No React hooks or dependencies

**Files:**
- `state.js` (68 lines) - State definitions, initial context, helper functions
- `transitions.js` (237 lines) - Main reducer and transition logic
- `timers.js` (89 lines) - Timer utilities and calculations
- `index.js` - Public API exports

**States:**
```
idle → breathing → root-cause → alternatives → action → action_timer → reflection → idle
                                     ↓
                                   timer (unlock)
```

**Relationship to System Brain and OS Trigger Brain:**
- System Brain JS receives mechanical events and classifies semantic meaning
- OS Trigger Brain (invoked by System Brain) decides WHEN to start intervention
- Intervention State Machine manages WHAT happens during intervention
- System Brain JS runs as headless task (event-driven)
- Intervention State Machine runs in SystemSurface context (UI-only)

**Usage in React Native (InterventionProvider.tsx):**
```typescript
import { useReducer } from 'react';
import {
  interventionReducer,
  createInitialInterventionContext,
} from '../core/intervention';

// Provider uses useReducer
const [interventionState, dispatchIntervention] = useReducer(
  interventionReducer,
  createInitialInterventionContext()
);

// Usage in screens (via useIntervention hook):
const { interventionState, dispatchIntervention } = useIntervention();

// Dispatch actions
dispatchIntervention({ type: 'SELECT_CAUSE', causeId: 'boredom' });

// Timer effects (in screen components)
useEffect(() => {
  if (shouldTickBreathing(interventionState.state, interventionState.breathingCount)) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      dispatchIntervention({ type: 'BREATHING_TICK' });
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [interventionState.state, interventionState.breathingCount]);
```

**Action Types:**
- `BEGIN_INTERVENTION` - Start intervention for an app
- `BREATHING_TICK` - Decrement breathing countdown
- `SELECT_CAUSE` / `DESELECT_CAUSE` - Toggle cause selection
- `PROCEED_TO_ALTERNATIVES` - Move to alternatives screen
- `PROCEED_TO_TIMER` - User chose "I really need to use it"
- `SELECT_ALTERNATIVE` - Select an alternative activity
- `START_ALTERNATIVE` - Start timer for alternative
- `ACTION_TIMER_TICK` - Decrement action timer
- `FINISH_ACTION` - User manually finishes action
- `FINISH_REFLECTION` - Complete reflection
- `GO_BACK_FROM_ACTION` - Return to alternatives
- `RESET_INTERVENTION` - Reset to idle

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reusable in React Native
- ✅ Testable (pure functions)
- ✅ Predictable state transitions
- ✅ No framework coupling
- ✅ Single source of truth

**See also:** `INTERVENTION_EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed extraction documentation

### State Management Strategy

**State Architecture:**
- Comprehensive state definitions documented in `design/ux/states.md`
- Root contexts: `launcher`, `app-mindful`, `app-{id}`
- Intervention flow states: `idle`, `breathing`, `root-cause`, `alternatives`, `action`, `action_timer`, `timer`, `reflection`
- Modal states: `showPlanModal`, `showAltScheduler`, `selectedActivity`, etc.
- See `design/ux/states.md` for complete state variable reference and transition matrix

**Persistence Layer:**
- React Native: Uses `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` or Expo SecureStore for persistence
- Web: Uses `localStorage` via `useStickyState` hook
- All user data persists across sessions
- Storage keys documented in [State Persistence Keys](#state-persistence-keys) section

**Mock Backend:**
- `src/mockApi.js` simulates server-side state for community features
- Provides functions like `createJoinRequestState`, `acceptJoinRequestState`, `declineJoinRequestState`
- Uses localStorage key `community_mock_state_v2` for persistence
- Ready to swap with real API calls when backend is available

### Component Architecture

**Alternatives Database:**
- **Location:** `src/constants/alternativesDatabase.ts`
- **Documentation:** `docs/alternatives-database.md`
- **Total Activities:** 36 predefined alternatives across 6 root causes
- **Root Causes:** Loneliness (7), Boredom (8), Fatigue (5), No Goal (5), Self-Doubt (5), Anxiety (6)
- **Features:**
  - `getAlternativesForCauses(selectedCauses)` - Get alternatives for selected root causes
  - `filterAlternativesByContext(alternatives, context)` - Filter by time of day, weather
  - Context-aware filtering (night time excludes social calls)
  - Sorted by popularity (likes)
  - Each activity includes: title, description, duration, type, tags, action steps
- **Usage:** `AlternativesScreen` Discover tab shows filtered alternatives based on selected causes
- **See:** `docs/ALTERNATIVES_DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for complete implementation details

**Modular Components:**
- `ActivityCard` - Displays activity cards in horizontal scrollable lists
  - Receives `upcomingActivities` prop to determine user's join status
  - Shows status badge (PENDING/CONFIRMED) only when activity is in user's `upcomingActivities`
  - Badge logic matches `ActivityDetailsModal` for consistency across all views
  - Uses `findUpcomingActivity()` from `utils/activityMatching.js` for status checking
  - Uses `HOST_LABELS_CARD` from `constants/hostLabels.js` for host type display
- `ActivityDetailsModal` - Full-screen contextual view for viewing/managing activities
  - **Structure**: Three-section tabbed interface (Details / Chat / Participants)
  - **Details Section**:
    - Host actions: Edit activity, Cancel event
    - Participant actions: Join event, Cancel request, Quit event
    - Checks `upcomingActivities` to determine if user has joined
    - Uses shared `findUpcomingActivity()` and `HOST_LABELS_MODAL` utilities
  - **Chat Section** (Event Group Chat v0.1 - Phase E-2b):
    - Event-scoped messaging (chat belongs to the event)
    - Message list with sender name and timestamps
    - Text input with send button
    - Access control: Only host and confirmed participants can chat
    - Messages stored per event using `utils/eventChat.js`
    - Auto-scroll to bottom on new messages
    - Empty state: "No messages yet" with helpful text
    - Restricted state: "Chat is available once you are confirmed" for pending users
  - **Participants Section**:
    - Confirmed participants list (host always shown first)
    - Pending requests management (host-only, with Accept/Decline actions)
  - Full-screen layout with header, section tabs, and close button
- `PlanActivityModal` - AI-powered or manual activity planning interface
  - Supports both create and edit modes
  - Edit mode pre-populates form with existing activity data
  - Uses `parseFormattedDate()`, `parseTimeString()`, `parseTimeRange()` from `utils/time.js` for date/time parsing
- `AltSchedulerModal` - Schedule alternatives for later (Plan for Later flow)
- `ActivitySuggestionCard` - Presents AI suggestions with Accept/Edit/Save actions

**Component Communication:**
- Parent-child prop drilling (no global state library)
- Callback props for user actions
- Shared state managed in App.js and passed down
- Shared utilities imported from `constants/` and `utils/` directories

### Key Features & Flows

**Note:** For detailed flow documentation, see `design/ux/flows.md` which contains 14 comprehensive user flows including:
- First-time onboarding
- Monitored app → Quick Task flow
- Monitored app → Full Intervention flow
- Community activity join flow
- Plan Activity with AI suggestions
- Edit/Cancel activity flows
- And more...

**1. System Surface Flows**

The System Surface is an OS-level activity that renders three distinct, mutually exclusive flows:

**A. Quick Task Flow (Emergency Bypass):**
- Purpose: Emergency bypass for urgent, necessary app usage
- Duration: Limited time window per app (e.g., 3 minutes)
- Timer Scope: PER-APP (each app has independent timer)
- Usage Count: GLOBAL (shared quota across all apps)
- Screens: `QuickTaskDialogScreen` → `QuickTaskExpiredScreen`
- Rules:
  - During Quick Task: User can use THAT SPECIFIC APP without intervention
  - Switching to a DIFFERENT monitored app triggers its own intervention check
  - Does NOT create or extend t_intention
  - On expiry: Show dedicated screen, reset timers, go to Home
  - No timer state from before Quick Task is resumed

**B. Intervention Flow (Conscious Process):**
- Purpose: Full mindfulness intervention for monitored app
- Duration: Variable, user-driven
- Scope: PER-APP (each monitored app independent)
- Screens: Breathing → Root Cause → Alternatives → Action/Timer → Reflection
- State Flow: `idle → breathing → root-cause → alternatives → action → action_timer → reflection → idle`
- Rules:
  - Each monitored app has independent intervention state
  - IntentionTimer sets t_intention (per-app)
  - ActionTimer suppresses interventions while alternative activity runs
  - After intervention: User returns to monitored app
  - t_intention blocks future interventions until it expires
- See `design/ux/states.md` for complete intervention state definitions and transitions

**C. Alternative Activity Flow:**
- Purpose: User is actively doing an alternative activity
- Duration: User-defined activity duration
- Scope: PER-APP (tied to specific monitored app)
- Suppresses interventions while activity is running

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Only ONE flow active at any time
- ✅ Flows are separate and mutually exclusive
- ✅ JavaScript decides which flow to show (via OS Trigger Brain)
- ✅ Native code only wakes the System Surface with a wake reason

**2. Activity Planning**
Three modes accessible via Community tab:
- **Private + AI**: User provides time/topic/location/participants → Gemini generates 3 specific suggestions → Accept/Edit/Save
- **Private + Manual**: Traditional form input for solo activities
- **Public Hosted**: Create events that publish to friends or public discover feed

**3. Community Features**
- **My Upcoming**: Confirmed solo activities and joined group activities
- **Discover**: Friends' current live activities + public events
- **Ask-to-Join Flow**: Users request → Host accepts/declines → Activity updates to confirmed
- **Live Join**: When starting an activity, host can allow live join for a 5-minute window
- **Activity Management**:
  - **Host Actions** (in Activity Details):
    - Shows "Edit activity" and "Cancel event" buttons
    - Edit activity: Opens PlanActivityModal in edit mode with pre-filled data
    - Cancel event: Removes activity from all lists (upcoming, shared, public)
  - **Participant Actions** (in Activity Details):
    - **"Join the event"**: Shown when activity is NOT in user's `upcomingActivities` list
    - **"Cancel request"**: Shown when activity is in `upcomingActivities` with "pending" status
    - **"Quit event"**: Shown when activity is in `upcomingActivities` with "confirmed" status
  - **Activity Status Logic**:
    - `hosting`: User is the host → Show host actions (Edit/Cancel), never show "Join the event"
    - `pending`: User has requested to join, waiting for approval → Show "Cancel request"
    - `confirmed`: Activity is confirmed (either approved by host or no approval needed) → Show "Quit event"
    - Other statuses: User hasn't joined → Show "Join the event"
  - **Status Badge Consistency**:
    - Both `ActivityCard` and `ActivityDetailsModal` check `upcomingActivities` to determine if user has joined
    - Status badge (PENDING/CONFIRMED) only shows when `userHasJoined = true` (activity found in `upcomingActivities`)
    - Same activity shows same badge status across "My Upcoming" and "Discover" sections
    - When user quits an event, activity is removed from `upcomingActivities`, so badge disappears everywhere

**4. Friends & Privacy**
- Friends list with success rate leaderboard
- Optional sharing: alternatives list, current activity, recent mood
- Privacy toggles in Settings → Social Privacy
- Notes per friend (stored locally)

## AI Integration

**Gemini API** (optional):
- Set `REACT_APP_GEMINI_KEY` environment variable
- Used for:
  - Activity planning suggestions (`PlanActivityModal`)
  - Alternative idea generation (AI For You tab)
  - Deep insights analysis (Insights screen)
- Implementation in `src/utils/gemini.js`
- Gracefully degrades if API key is missing

**Plan an Activity (Private + AI Suggestion):**
- Function: `generateActivitySuggestions()` in `PlanActivityModal.jsx`
- Triggered when user clicks "Generate suggestions" in Community → Plan an activity → Private + AI suggestion mode
- Generates 3 **specific and concrete** activity suggestions using Gemini API
- **AI Behavior:** Provides specific recommendations (e.g., actual movie titles, real venue names, concrete plans) rather than generic suggestions
- **Inputs** (all optional, from user form):
  1. `topic` - User's interest/topic (e.g., "watch a movie in a theater", "stretching", "social")
  2. `location` - Preferred location (e.g., "Park, cafe, online", "Munich downtown")
  3. `timePreference` - Time of day preference: "Morning", "Afternoon", or "Evening"
  4. `date` - ISO date string (defaults to `defaultDate` prop, typically today)
  5. `participantsDescription` - Number of participants and preferences (e.g., "2-4 people, prefer quiet activities", "Recommend a romantic movie for me with my girlfriend")
- **Input Priority Order** (as specified in AI prompt):
  1. **Topic/Interest** (PRIMARY) - Match the topic/interest if provided
  2. **Location** - Can be done at or near the specified location
  3. **Time of Day** - Appropriate for the time preference
  4. **Participants Description** - Consider number of people and their preferences
  5. **Date** - Mentioned but lower priority
- **Default Values** (when inputs are empty):
  - **In AI Prompt:**
    - `topic`: `"general wellness"`
    - `location`: `"flexible location"`
    - `timePreference`: `"any time"`
    - `date`: `"today"`
    - `participantsDescription`: `"no specific participant preferences"`
  - **In Response Processing** (when AI response is missing fields):
    - `title`: `"Suggested Activity"`
    - `description`: `"No description provided"`
    - `time`: From `getDefaultTime()` function (see below)
    - `location`: `"Your preferred location"`
    - `topic`: `"General wellness"`
    - `duration`: `"30-60m"`
  - **Default Time Values** (based on time preference):
    - Morning: `["08:00", "09:30", "07:00"]` (for 3 suggestions)
    - Afternoon: `["14:00", "15:30", "16:00"]`
    - Evening: `["18:30", "19:00", "20:00"]`
    - No preference: `["09:00", "14:00", "18:30"]`
    - Fallback: `"09:00"`
- **Output Format:**
  - JSON array of 3 activity objects
  - Each object contains: 
    - `title` - Specific activity name (e.g., "Watch 'Past Lives' at Cinema München")
    - `description` - Detailed description with concrete recommendations, venue names, movie titles, etc.
    - `duration` - Estimated time like "30-45m" or "120-150m"
    - `time` - Suggested start time in HH:MM format (24-hour)
- **AI Output Requirements:**
  - Must be specific and concrete (not generic wellness suggestions)
  - Should recommend actual movie titles, restaurant names, venue details when relevant
  - Should include location details in descriptions
  - Example: If user asks for "romantic movie with girlfriend", AI suggests specific movie titles at specific theaters
- **Error Handling:**
  - Falls back to `getFallbackSuggestions()` if API fails or returns invalid response
  - Fallback provides 3 generic suggestions using form inputs
  - Shows error message in UI if generation fails

**AI For You Tab (Intervention Flow):**
- Function: `handleGenerateContextualAlternatives()` in `App.js`
- Triggered automatically when user opens "AI For You" tab after selecting root causes
- Generates 3 contextual alternative activity suggestions using Gemini API
- **Input Priority Order** (from most to least important):
  1. **Root causes/emotions** (PRIMARY) - Selected emotional states (boredom, anxiety, fatigue, loneliness, self-doubt, no goal)
  2. **Location** - User's current location (`USER_LOCATION` constant, default: "Munich")
  3. **Social context** - Nearby friends within 50km (same location as proxy)
     - Includes friend names, locations, and current/recent activities
     - Suggests activities that could involve joining friends if appropriate
  4. **User's values/goals** - Core values from `selectedValues` state
     - Maps to labels: Career, Health, Love, Kids, Reading, Nature, Social
     - AI prioritizes activities aligned with these values
  5. **User's saved alternatives/preferences** - Historical activity data
     - Saved alternatives from `savedAlternativeIds`
     - Custom alternatives from `customAlternatives`
     - Recent activities from `sessionHistory` (last 10 sessions)
     - Shows top 5 preferences to guide similar suggestions
  6. **Time of day** - Current time (`currentTime` state)
     - Determines morning/afternoon/evening/night context
     - Influences time-appropriate activity suggestions
  7. **Weather** - Current weather condition (`weather` state: "sunny" or "rainy")
  8. **Target app** - App that triggered the intervention (e.g., "Instagram", "TikTok")
- **Prompt Structure:**
  - Primary context section with emotional state and location
  - Conditional sections for social context, values, and preferences (only if available)
  - Time, weather, and trigger app information
  - Instructions to prioritize emotional state first, then contextual factors
- **Output Format:**
  - JSON array of 3 activity objects
  - Each object contains: `title`, `desc`, `duration`, `actions` (array of 3 steps), `type`
  - Types: social/calm/creative/active/productive/rest
- **Error Handling:**
  - Gracefully handles missing data (e.g., no friends, no values set, empty history)
  - Falls back to basic suggestions if API fails
  - Shows toast notifications for errors

## Important Implementation Details

### Event Update Signal System (Phase E-2c)

**Purpose:**  
A unified architectural system for emitting structured update signals when event-related actions occur. These signals are consumed by Inbox v1 (Phase E-2d).

### Inbox v1 (Phase E-2d)

**Purpose:**  
Provides a dedicated coordination surface for users to receive and manage event-related updates. The Inbox is a top-level tab with two sub-tabs: Messages (placeholder) and Updates (fully functional).

**Architecture:**
- All event-related actions emit `EventUpdate` objects
- Updates stored in localStorage (`event_updates_v1`)
- Updates logged to console for debugging
- No UI rendering in this phase (data-only)

**EventUpdate Data Model:**
```javascript
{
  id: string                    // Unique update ID
  type: string                  // One of: event_chat, join_request, join_approved, 
                                //   join_declined, event_updated, event_cancelled, 
                                //   participant_left
  eventId: string              // Associated event ID
  actorId: string              // User who triggered the update
  actorName: string            // Display name of actor
  message: string              // Short preview or description (optional)
  createdAt: number            // Timestamp
  resolved: boolean            // Always false (resolution logic in future phase)
}
```

**Emission Points:**
1. **Event Chat Message Sent** → `event_chat` update
   - Location: `ActivityDetailsModal.handleSendMessage()`
   - Includes message text preview (truncated to 50 chars)

2. **Join Request Created** → `join_request` update
   - Location: `App.handleRequestToJoin()`
   - Actor: User requesting to join

3. **Join Request Accepted** → `join_approved` update
   - Location: `App.handleAcceptRequest()`
   - Actor: Host who accepted

4. **Join Request Declined** → `join_declined` update
   - Location: `App.handleDeclineRequest()`
   - Actor: Host who declined

5. **Event Updated** → `event_updated` update
   - Location: `App.handleUpdateActivity()`
   - Actor: User who edited the event
   - Message: "Event details updated"

6. **Event Cancelled** → `event_cancelled` update
   - Location: `App.handleCancelActivity()`
   - Actor: Host who cancelled

7. **Participant Left** → `participant_left` update
   - Location: `App.handleQuitActivity()`
   - Actor: User who quit

**Design Constraints:**
- No UI added in Phase E-2c (data-only)
- Updates append-only (no deduplication)

**Inbox v1 Architecture (Phase E-2d):**

**Location:** `src/utils/inbox.js` - Inbox utility functions  
**Navigation:** Bottom tab between Community and Settings  
**Badge:** Shows unresolved update count (Community is NEVER badged)

**Sub-tabs:**
1. **Messages** - Placeholder only, shows "No messages yet" empty state
2. **Updates** - Fully functional, renders all unresolved EventUpdate items

**Update Rendering:**
- Type-specific icons and text for all 7 update types
- Sorted by time (most recent first)
- Shows event title, optional message preview, and relative timestamp
- Tappable items with deep-linking to Activity Details

**Resolution Logic:**
- `event_chat` → Resolves when Chat tab opened in Activity Details
- `join_request` → Resolves when host accepts/declines
- `join_approved` / `join_declined` → Resolves immediately when activity opened
- `event_updated` / `event_cancelled` / `participant_left` → Resolves immediately when activity opened
- Updates removed from list after resolution
- Badge count automatically decrements

**Integration Points:**
- `ActivityDetailsModal` calls `onChatOpened()` when Chat tab opens
- `handleAcceptRequest()` and `handleDeclineRequest()` resolve join_request updates
- `handleUpdateClick()` handles deep-linking and type-specific resolution

### Private Messaging System

**Purpose:**  
Provides unified private (friend-to-friend) messaging accessible from multiple entry points. Completely separate from event group chat.

**Architecture:**

**Entry Points:**
1. Community → Friends list → Chat icon
2. Community → Friend profile → Chat button
3. Inbox → Messages → Conversation list

**Data Storage:**
- Single source of truth: `private_messages_v1` in localStorage
- Format: `{ [conversationId]: PrivateConversation }`
- Conversation ID: Deterministic based on sorted participant IDs (`conv_userId1_userId2`)

**Message Flow:**
- User sends message → `handleSendChatMessage()` → `addMessageToConversation()` → localStorage
- Chat UI reads from `getConversation(conversationId)`
- Inbox reads from `getAllConversationsSorted()`
- Both views show same data

**Key Features:**
- Automatic migration from old `chatMessages` format (runs once)
- Conversations sorted by last message time
- Last message preview in Inbox
- Proper timestamps (shown as "9:30 AM" in chat, "2m ago" in list)
- Opens same conversation regardless of entry point

**Separation from Event Chat:**
- Private messages: Friend-to-friend, stored in `private_messages_v1`
- Event chat: Group chat per event, stored in `event_chat_state_v1`
- No overlap or confusion between the two systems

### Unread & Resolution Semantics (Phase E-2e)

**Purpose:**  
Implement correct, minimal, non-coercive unread and resolution logic for Inbox v1 to ensure users are informed without pressure.

**Private Messages — Unread Logic:**
- Conversation is UNREAD if:
  - Latest message sent by OTHER user
  - Conversation not opened since that message
- Conversation marked READ when user opens it
- All messages in conversation marked read together
- No read receipts sent to other user
- `lastReadAt` field tracks read state per conversation

**Updates — Resolution Logic:**
- Updates remain UNRESOLVED until explicit user action
- Resolution rules per type (unchanged from Phase E-2d)
- Opening Inbox does NOT auto-resolve updates
- Must open specific context or take action

**Badge Logic:**
- **Inbox tab badge:** `unreadConversations + unresolvedUpdates`
- **Messages badge:** Count of unread conversations
- **Updates badge:** Count of unresolved updates
- **Other tabs:** NEVER badged (Community, Insights, Settings)
- Badges update immediately when state changes
- No color escalation, pulsing, or animation

**Key Functions:**
- `isConversationUnread(conversation, userId)` - Check if conversation has unread messages
- `markConversationAsRead(conversationId)` - Mark conversation as read
- `getUnreadConversationCount(userId)` - Count unread conversations

**Stability Rules:**
- If user ignores Inbox → unread state remains as-is
- No escalation occurs
- No reminders or nudges
- Unread indicates STATE, not OBLIGATION

### State Persistence Keys
When debugging or resetting state, be aware of these localStorage keys:
- `mindful_*_v17_2` - Main app state (values, monitored apps, plan, etc.)
- `mindful_*_v17_6` - Settings and friends (includes new privacy fields)
- `community_mock_state_v2` - Community activities and requests
- `event_chat_state_v1` - Event Group Chat messages (Phase E-2b)
- `event_updates_v1` - Event update signals consumed by Inbox (Phase E-2c/E-2d)
- `private_messages_v1` - Private friend-to-friend conversations (unified messaging)
- `private_messages_migrated_v1` - Migration flag for one-time chatMessages migration

### Cold Start Timeline

Understanding the cold start sequence is critical for debugging System Surface issues:

```
t0  User opens Instagram
t1  Android OS switches foreground app → Instagram
t2  AccessibilityService still alive
t3  AccessibilityService detects monitored app
t4  Native decides: need to wake SystemSurface
t5  Native launches SystemSurfaceActivity
t6  Android creates NEW Activity + NEW RN Context
t7  React Native initializes
t8  SystemSurfaceRoot first render
    - session = null
    - bootstrapState = BOOTSTRAPPING
    - ❌ MUST NOT finish
t9  JS reads from native:
    - wakeReason
    - triggeringApp
t10 JS runs OS Trigger Brain in【SystemSurface Context】
t11 OS Trigger Brain makes decision:
    - START_INTERVENTION / START_QUICK_TASK /
      START_ALTERNATIVE_ACTIVITY / DO_NOTHING
t12 JS dispatches SystemSession event
t13 JS sets bootstrapState = READY
t14 SystemSurfaceRoot renders again
    - If session !== null → render corresponding Flow
    - If session === null → finish SystemSurfaceActivity
```

**Critical Insight:** During t8-t13, `session === null` does NOT mean "finish immediately". It means "decision not made yet". The bootstrap state protects against premature finish().

### Quick Task System

**Purpose:** Emergency bypass for urgent, necessary app usage

**Configuration:**
- 15-minute rolling window with configurable uses per window
- Premium feature: customize duration (10s for testing, 2/3/5 min for prod) and uses (1-2)
- Free plan: locked to 3min duration, 1 use per window

**Scope:**
- **t_quickTask** (timer): PER-APP - Each app has its own independent Quick Task timer
- **n_quickTask** (usage count): GLOBAL - Shared quota across all monitored apps

**Rules:**
1. Quick Task temporarily suppresses all intervention triggers for THAT SPECIFIC APP
2. During t_quickTask: User may freely switch apps and return to monitored apps
3. Quick Task does NOT create or extend t_intention
4. When t_quickTask expires:
   - t_intention is reset to 0
   - System shows QuickTaskExpiredScreen
   - User presses button and goes to home screen
5. After Quick Task expiry:
   - Next opening of a monitored app triggers:
     - the intervention process, OR
     - the Quick Task dialog (if n_quickTask allows)
6. No timer state from before the Quick Task is resumed or reused
7. n_quickTask is counted globally across all monitored apps within the window

**Flow:**
```
QuickTaskDialogScreen → [User chooses Quick Task]
  → Quick Task Active (timer running, interventions suppressed)
  → Timer expires
  → QuickTaskExpiredScreen
  → User clicks "Go Home"
  → Reset timers, navigate to home
```

### Incomplete Intervention Cancellation

When user switches away from a monitored app, cancel intervention ONLY if it's incomplete.

**Incomplete States (Cancel Intervention):**
- **`breathing`** - User hasn't finished breathing
- **`root-cause`** - User hasn't selected causes
- **`alternatives`** - User hasn't chosen alternative
- **`action`** - User hasn't started activity
- **`reflection`** - User hasn't finished reflection

**Complete/Preserved States (Do NOT Cancel):**
- **`action_timer`** - User is doing alternative activity → preserve
- **`timer`** - User set `t_intention` → this transitions to idle AND launches the app, so user can use it normally → preserve
- **`idle`** - No intervention → nothing to cancel

**Key Insight:** When user sets `t_intention`, the intervention completes and transitions to `idle`, then the app launches normally. The `t_intention` timer is now active and will suppress future interventions until it expires.

**Implementation:**
- Native code detects app switch via AccessibilityService
- Native checks current intervention state
- If state is incomplete → cancel intervention, reset state
- If state is complete/preserved → keep state, timer continues

### Modal Rendering Pattern
Modals are rendered at the root level to ensure proper z-index stacking:
- `renderGlobalModals()` function in launcher context
- `AltSchedulerModal` accessible from both intervention flow and community tab
- State props: `showAltScheduler`, `altPlanDraft`

### Time Utilities
`src/utils/time.js` provides comprehensive time and date utilities:

**Time Conversion:**
- `timeToMins(time)` - Convert "HH:MM" to minutes
- `minsToTime(mins)` - Convert minutes to "HH:MM"
- `addMinutes(time, mins)` - Add minutes to a time string
- `formatSeconds(totalSeconds)` - Format countdown timers
- `formatQuickTaskDuration(minutes, options)` - Format duration with optional long format

**Date/Time Parsing** (used by PlanActivityModal for edit mode):
- `parseFormattedDate(dateStr, defaultDate)` - Parses formatted dates (e.g., "Mon, Nov 18") to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Handles year inference for dates that may be in the next year
  - Returns ISO format if already provided
- `parseTimeString(timeStr)` - Parses time strings to HH:MM 24-hour format
  - Supports: "9:30 AM", "09:30 AM", "9:30", "19:30"
  - Converts 12-hour format with AM/PM to 24-hour format
- `parseTimeRange(timeStr)` - Extracts start and end times from range strings
  - Handles: "9:30 AM - 11:00 AM", "9:30 - 11:00", single times
  - Returns: `{ start: "09:30", end: "11:00" }` or `{ start: "09:30", end: "" }`

**Date/Time Formatting in BreakLoopConfig:**
- `formatDateLabel(dateVal)` - Formats ISO date to "Weekday, Month Day" (e.g., "Sat, Dec 13")
- `buildTimeLabel(start, end)` - Formats time range as "HH:MM - HH:MM" or single time "HH:MM"
- Both functions are defined within BreakLoopConfig component scope

## Development Workflow Notes

**From DEVELOPMENT_NOTE_PLAN_ACTIVITY.md:**
- AI stub `generateActivitySuggestions()` returns 3 mock ideas; replace with backend call when ready
- Activities persist via `communityData` → `persistCommunityState` (localStorage)
- Group creation publishes to `publicEvents` when visibility is public
- Modal state resets on close (handleClose) to prevent stuck states
- "Back to form" button clears AI suggestions and returns to input form
- Accepting/saving/creating activities triggers modal reset for clean reopening

**QA Checklist:**
- Solo manual save adds item to My Upcoming with confirmed status
- Solo AI Accept/Save adds confirmed item to My Upcoming
- Solo AI Edit populates manual form and clears suggestions
- Group Create & Publish adds to My Upcoming and Discover (based on visibility)
- Pending join requests render in host modal and can be accepted
- localStorage updates on activity changes (refresh retains new activities)
- **Activity Management:**
  - Host can edit activity (title, description, date, start/end time, location, visibility)
  - Host can cancel event (removes from all lists, shows toast confirmation)
  - Non-host participants can quit event (removes from their upcoming list only)
  - Edit mode pre-populates all fields correctly, including time range parsing
  - Form validation prevents saving incomplete activities
- **Activity Details Modal Button Logic:**
  - `isHost = true`: Shows "Edit activity" and "Cancel event" buttons only
  - `isHost = false` + activity in `upcomingActivities`: Shows "Quit event" (if confirmed) or "Cancel request" (if pending)
  - `isHost = false` + activity NOT in `upcomingActivities`: Shows "Join the event"
  - Status badges ("CONFIRMED", "PENDING") only shown when `userHasJoined = true` (activity found in `upcomingActivities`)
  - Host users see "Host" badge instead of status badges
- **Status Badge Consistency:**
  - `ActivityCard` and `ActivityDetailsModal` both check `upcomingActivities` to determine join status
  - Same activity shows same badge in "My Upcoming" and "Discover" sections
  - Badge disappears when user quits event (activity removed from `upcomingActivities`)
  - All `ActivityCard` instances receive `upcomingActivities={state.upcomingActivities || []}` prop

## Code Style & Patterns

**Lucide React Icons:**
- All icons imported from `lucide-react`
- Consistent sizing: `<Icon size={16} />` for buttons, `<Icon size={12} />` for labels
- **Important:** Icons in exported constants must be wrapped in functions (e.g., `icon: () => <Users size={12} />`) to avoid React context issues

**Tailwind Utility Classes:**
- Extensive use of Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design
- Custom animations: `animate-in`, `slide-in-from-bottom`, `zoom-in-95`

**React Patterns:**
- Functional components with hooks
- useMemo for expensive computations and JSX elements
- useCallback for stable function references
- useRef for DOM references and mutable values
- Reducer pattern for complex state machines (intervention flow)

**Code Quality:**
- No debug logging or external fetch calls in production code
- Shared utilities extracted to avoid duplication
- Constants centralized in `constants/` directory
- Core business logic extracted to `core/` directory (framework-agnostic)
- All components use shared utilities for consistent behavior

**State Machine Pattern:**
- Intervention flow uses extracted reducer pattern
- Pure functions for state transitions
- Framework-agnostic core logic in `src/core/intervention/`
- React layer only handles UI and side effects (timers, storage)

## Testing Considerations

- Mock data in `src/mockActivities.js` provides seed data
- Demo mode (`demoMode` state) disables persistence for testing
- Quick Task testing timer: 10 seconds (auto-enabled in demo mode)
- `mockApi.test.js` exists but implementation is minimal

## Recent Refactoring (December 2025)

The codebase underwent incremental refactoring to improve maintainability while preserving all existing functionality:

**Phase 1 - Cleanup & Security:**
- Removed all debug logging (external fetch calls to hardcoded debug endpoints)
- Eliminated 8+ debug fetch calls from `mockApi.js`, `App.js`, and `ActivityDetailsModal.js`
- Cleaned up console.log debug statements

**Phase 2 - Extract Shared Utilities:**
- Created `constants/hostLabels.js` - Extracted duplicate HOST_LABELS from ActivityCard and ActivityDetailsModal
- Created `utils/activityMatching.js` - Extracted `findUpcomingActivity()` logic (20+ lines of duplicate code)
- Enhanced `utils/time.js` - Added date/time parsing functions from PlanActivityModal
  - `parseFormattedDate()`, `parseTimeString()`, `parseTimeRange()`
  - 107 lines of parsing logic now reusable and testable
- Created `constants/config.js` - Centralized app configuration constants
  - Version, location, Quick Task settings, default values

**Impact:**
- **-218 lines** of duplicate/debug code removed
- **+96 lines** added in reusable utilities
- **Net improvement:** -122 lines + better organization
- Build verified: No breaking changes, all functionality preserved
- Components now share utilities for consistent behavior

**Files Created:**
- `src/constants/hostLabels.js` (19 lines)
- `src/constants/config.js` (48 lines)
- `src/utils/activityMatching.js` (29 lines)

**Files Significantly Modified:**
- `src/App.js` (6,442 → 6,385 lines, -57 lines)
- `src/components/PlanActivityModal.jsx` (904 → 797 lines, -107 lines)
- `src/utils/time.js` (30 → 158 lines, +128 lines for new parsing functions)

**Phase 3 - Extract Intervention State Machine (December 2025):**
- Extracted intervention flow logic into framework-agnostic core module
- Created `src/core/intervention/` directory with pure JavaScript functions
- Converted 6 separate `useState` calls to single `interventionContext` state
- Implemented reducer pattern for predictable state transitions
- All intervention logic now reusable in React Native

**Files Created:**
- `src/core/intervention/state.js` (68 lines) - State definitions
- `src/core/intervention/transitions.js` (237 lines) - Transition logic
- `src/core/intervention/timers.js` (89 lines) - Timer utilities
- `src/core/intervention/index.js` (11 lines) - Public API
- `INTERVENTION_EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed extraction documentation

**Files Modified:**
- React Native: `src/contexts/InterventionProvider.tsx` - React Context provider using interventionReducer
- React Native: `app/App.tsx` - Navigation handler that watches intervention state
- React Native: Screen components use `useIntervention()` hook to access state

**Impact:**
- **+394 lines** of framework-agnostic core logic
- **Zero behavior changes** - all functionality preserved
- **Build verified** - compiles successfully
- **Ready for React Native** - same logic can be reused

**Phase 4 - App Switch Intervention Fix (December 29, 2025):**
- Fixed issue where intervention state mixed between different monitored apps
- Each app now gets its own independent intervention flow
- Switching apps during intervention resets state and starts fresh

**Problem Fixed:**
- When switching from Instagram to TikTok during intervention, the old intervention state (root causes, selected alternatives) was carried over
- Wrong app name displayed in intervention UI
- Confusing user experience with mixed state

**Solution:**
- Updated `interventionReducer` to always reset state on `BEGIN_INTERVENTION`
- Updated navigation handler to watch both `state` and `targetApp` for app switches
- Updated `triggerIntervention()` in OS Trigger Brain to clear previous in-progress flags
- Ensured only ONE app can have active intervention at a time

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/intervention/transitions.js` - State reset logic on app switch
- `app/App.tsx` - Navigation handler watches state AND targetApp
- `src/os/osTriggerBrain.ts` - Clear previous interventions before starting new one

**Documentation Created:**
- `docs/APP_SWITCH_INTERVENTION_FIX.md` - Detailed fix documentation
- `docs/APP_SWITCH_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Quick summary
- `docs/TEST_APP_SWITCH_INTERVENTION.md` - Complete test plan

**Impact:**
- ✅ Each monitored app gets independent intervention flow
- ✅ No state mixing between apps
- ✅ Correct app name displayed in UI
- ✅ Navigation always resets to breathing screen on app switch
- ✅ Clean user experience when switching apps


## Context Ownership Rules

**System Brain JS (Event-Driven Headless) MUST:**
- Receive mechanical events from native ("TIMER_EXPIRED", "FOREGROUND_CHANGED")
- Classify semantic meaning (Quick Task vs Intention)
- Run OS Trigger Brain logic
- Decide whether to launch SystemSurface
- Load state from persistent storage on each event
- Save state to persistent storage after processing
- Request SystemSurface launch via native module

**System Brain JS MUST NOT:**
- Render UI
- Use React components
- Assume continuous execution
- Maintain state in memory between events

**SystemSurface JS MUST (Phase 2 - Render Only):**
- Receive **explicit wake reason** from System Brain (`SHOW_QUICK_TASK_DIALOG`, `START_INTERVENTION_FLOW`)
- **Directly dispatch session** based on wake reason (no logic, no re-evaluation)
- Dispatch START_* events (START_INTERVENTION, START_QUICK_TASK, START_ALTERNATIVE_ACTIVITY)
- Control bootstrap lifecycle (BOOTSTRAPPING → READY)
- Render appropriate flow based on session.kind
- Report user decisions to System Brain

**SystemSurface JS MUST NOT:**
- Call `evaluateTriggerLogic()` (System Brain already pre-decided)
- Re-evaluate OS Trigger Brain priority chain
- Use setTimeout for semantic timers
- Make semantic decisions about intervention logic
- Assume session exists on mount
- Finish activity during BOOTSTRAPPING

**MainApp JS MUST:**
- Handle user features (settings, community)
- Request native wake only (via native module)

**MainApp JS MUST NOT:**
- Create or modify SystemSession
- Dispatch START_* events
- Run OS Trigger Brain
- Handle system-level intervention logic

**Native (Kotlin) MUST:**
- Emit MECHANICAL events to System Brain ("TIMER_EXPIRED", "FOREGROUND_CHANGED")
- Launch SystemSurfaceActivity when requested by System Brain
- Pass wakeReason + triggeringApp to SystemSurface
- Detect events and persist timestamps

**Native (Kotlin) MUST NOT:**
- Create session
- Interpret session
- Manage bootstrap state
- Make semantic decisions (Quick Task vs Intervention)
- Label events with semantic meaning

**Bootstrap Failure Modes:**
| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|-----------|
| App returns to Home immediately | finish() called during BOOTSTRAPPING |
| App hangs with no UI | Session created in MainApp context |
| No intervention shows | System Brain not receiving events or not launching SystemSurface |
| Infinite loading | bootstrap never set to READY |
| Timers don't fire | setTimeout in SystemSurface instead of System Brain |
| Semantic logic in wrong place | OS Trigger Brain in SystemSurface instead of System Brain |

## React Native Implementation

**Current Status:** React Native app is actively developed using the shared core logic.

**Three-Runtime Architecture:**
- **System Brain JS** (Headless Task → `src/systemBrain/`)
  - Event-driven headless runtime
  - Receives mechanical events from native
  - Classifies semantic meaning
  - Runs OS Trigger Brain logic
  - Decides when to launch SystemSurface
  - Loads/saves state on each event
  - NEVER renders UI

- **System Surface Context** (`InterventionActivity` → `SystemSurfaceRoot.tsx`)
  - OS-level overlay for interventions
  - Separate React Native instance
  - Receives wake reason from System Brain
  - Creates SystemSession and renders appropriate flow
  - Manages bootstrap lifecycle (BOOTSTRAPPING → READY)
  - UI-only, NO semantic timers

- **Main App Context** (`MainActivity` → `MainAppRoot.tsx`)
  - Normal app launched by user
  - Bottom tabs: Insights, Community, Inbox, Settings
  - Community uses stack navigator for sub-screens
  - User features only
  - NEVER creates SystemSession or runs OS Trigger Brain

**Framework-Agnostic Core:**
- `src/core/intervention/` contains pure JavaScript with no React dependencies
- Imported and used via `InterventionProvider` React Context
- Same business logic shared between web and mobile implementations

**React Native Architecture:**
- **Navigation:** React Navigation v7 (Stack + Bottom Tabs)
- **State Management:** React Context + useReducer pattern
- **Screens:** Separate screen components in `app/screens/`
- **Flows:** Separate flow components in `app/flows/`
- **Intervention Flow:** Modal-style navigation triggered by state changes
- **Navigation Handler:** `InterventionNavigationHandler` in `app/App.tsx` watches intervention state and navigates accordingly

**Implementation Details:**
- Intervention screens are modal-style (`presentation: 'modal'` in RootNavigator)
- State-driven navigation: intervention state changes trigger screen navigation
- SystemSurfaceRoot handles bootstrap lifecycle and session rendering
- MainAppRoot handles normal app navigation
- Each context has its own React Native instance and state

**What's Shared:**
- ✅ Intervention state machine (`src/core/intervention/`)
- ✅ Core business logic (framework-agnostic)
- ✅ OS Trigger Brain logic (`src/os/osTriggerBrain.ts`)
- ✅ System Brain event-driven architecture (`src/systemBrain/`)

**React Native Specific:**
- ✅ UI components use React Native primitives (View, Text, ScrollView, etc.)
- ✅ Storage uses AsyncStorage/Expo SecureStore instead of localStorage
- ✅ Navigation uses React Navigation instead of context switching
- ✅ Icons use `lucide-react-native` instead of `lucide-react`
- ✅ Screens are separate components instead of conditional rendering
- ✅ Three-runtime architecture (System Brain, SystemSurface, MainApp)
- ✅ System Brain runs as React Native Headless JS task
