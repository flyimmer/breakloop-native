# Product Intent — BreakLoop (Android)

## What this app is
BreakLoop helps people use their phone consciously and reduce unwanted screen time, especially in high-regret apps (social, short video, etc.). It inserts a short “pause” moment when a monitored app is opened, then supports the user to either:
- exit the app,
- use it intentionally for a limited time (Quick Task),
- or replace the urge with an alternative activity.

## Who it’s for
Anyone who feels they spend too much time on their phone and wants to reduce screen time without harsh blocking.

Primary user situations:
- “I open Instagram/XHS without noticing.”
- “I’m bored/tired/stressed and I reach for the phone.”
- “I want to check one thing quickly but I get pulled into scrolling.”

## User archetypes

### 1) The Doomscroller (Autopilot Loop)
**Profile**: Opens social/short-video apps automatically and loses 20–60 minutes without noticing.  
**Trigger moments**: Idle micro-moments (waiting, bathroom, bed), “just a second” opens.  
**Core problem**: Low awareness + infinite feed = time disappears.  
**Needs from BreakLoop**:
- A fast “snap-out-of-it” pause that breaks the loop
- An easy “Close app” action (frictionless exit)
- Quick Task for “I only need 1 thing” without sliding into the feed

### 2) The Busy Checker (Task Intent → Feed Trap)
**Profile**: Has a legitimate intent (reply, check a message, look up info), but gets hijacked by recommendations.  
**Trigger moments**: Notifications, work breaks, switching contexts.  
**Core problem**: Intent is real, but apps hijack attention after intent is completed.  
**Needs from BreakLoop**:
- Quick Task as the default “intent container” (time/quota bounded)
- Post-Quick-Task choice that nudges “Close app” once task is done
- Minimal steps; too much process causes drop-off

### 3) The Nighttime Escaper (Stress / Loneliness / Avoidance)
**Profile**: Uses phone to regulate emotions at night; scrolling is self-soothing but harms sleep and mood.  
**Trigger moments**: Bedtime, after conflict, when anxious or lonely.  
**Core problem**: The “why” matters more than the app; alternatives must match emotion.  
**Needs from BreakLoop**:
- A calmer, non-timer “Pause” that reduces urgency
- Root-cause flow that feels empathetic, not clinical
- Very small alternative set (1–3) with an explanation (“why this helps now”)

### 4) The Bored Micro-User (Filler Habit)
**Profile**: Not deeply addicted, but uses phone reflexively whenever bored; lots of short sessions.  
**Trigger moments**: Elevators, queues, commuting, between tasks.  
**Core problem**: Habit + boredom → repeated openings; high frequency, low value.  
**Needs from BreakLoop**:
- Ultra-light intervention (2–5 seconds) that doesn’t feel punishing
- “Do nothing for 10 seconds” or micro-alternatives
- Positive reinforcement (“nice catch”) rather than guilt

### 5) The Determined Reducer (Goal-Driven Improver)
**Profile**: Actively trying to cut screen time; wants tracking, progress, and clear rules.  
**Trigger moments**: Planned behavior change (New Year, after burnout), experimenting with tools.  
**Core problem**: Wants structure + measurable progress; too soft feels ineffective.  
**Needs from BreakLoop**:
- Clear settings (monitored apps, Quick Task window/quota, breathing duration)
- Transparent metrics (“conscious starts”, time saved, streaks later)
- Predictable behavior (no surprises, no random blocking)

## Success metrics (product goals)
### Behavior outcomes
- For monitored apps, reduce screen time by ≥ 50% compared to baseline (e.g., last 7–14 days before using BreakLoop).
- Increase “conscious” phone usage: ≥ 80% of usage sessions start with a deliberate choice (vs autopilot).

### Engagement outcomes
- Users keep monitored apps configured and active.
- Users use BreakLoop regularly (weekly retention).
- Users recommend BreakLoop to friends (NPS / referral intent).

## Philosophy
- Not strict blocking. BreakLoop is a coach, not a wall.
- Encourage awareness before action: create a pause that makes “autopilot” less likely.
- Use multiple techniques: micro-breathing, choice architecture, friction reduction for quitting, and meaningful alternatives.
- Teach insight over time: help users understand the damage of constant phone use and find replacements that fit the user’s root cause.

## Differentiation (vs One Sec)
Inspired by One Sec’s “pause before opening,” but BreakLoop adds:
- **Quick Task:** allow limited, intentional use with a quota/time budget per window.
- **Root-cause-aware alternatives:** propose replacements based on why the user wants the app right now.

## Scope & non-goals (current version)
- Focus on local/offline-first experiences.
- No backend-heavy features for now: no community, no shared alternative lists, no messaging.
- UI polish comes later; immediate priority is flow clarity, reduced friction, and better decisions.
