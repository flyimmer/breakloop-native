# BreakLoop OS-Level UI Architecture

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE - This document defines the canonical architecture

---

## Part 1: Conceptual Clarification

### System Surface Activity (Conceptual)

The Android activity currently named `InterventionActivity` is **conceptually** a neutral **System Surface**.

**What it is:**
- An OS-level activity that appears on top of other apps
- A rendering container for multiple independent flows
- Infrastructure, not semantics

**What it is NOT:**
- Not exclusively for interventions
- Not tied to any specific flow logic
- Not implying "intervention" by its existence

**Conceptual Name:** `SystemSurfaceActivity`  
**Current Implementation:** `InterventionActivity` (keep for now unless trivial to rename)

**Key Principle:**  
The System Surface is a **neutral stage**. Different flows render on this stage, but the stage itself has no opinion about which flow is shown.

**🔒 CRITICAL: Lifecycle Contract**  
All SystemSurface implementations MUST follow the lifecycle invariants defined in `SystemSurface Lifecycle Contract (Authoritative).md`. This contract defines non-negotiable rules for single-instance behavior, exclusive input ownership, and deterministic lifecycle management. **Read this contract before implementing or modifying SystemSurface behavior.**

---

## Part 1A: Runtime Context & Bootstrap Lifecycle

### Runtime Context

Determines *which UI world* React Native is running in.

```ts
type RuntimeContext = 'MAIN_APP' | 'SYSTEM_SURFACE';
```

- `MainActivity` → `MAIN_APP`
- `SystemSurfaceActivity` → `SYSTEM_SURFACE`

**Critical Rule:** Each context has separate React Native instances and separate state.

### System Session

Defines **whether SystemSurfaceActivity has a legitimate reason to exist**.

```ts
type SystemSession =
  | { kind: 'INTERVENTION'; app: AppId }
  | { kind: 'QUICK_TASK'; app: AppId }
  | { kind: 'ALTERNATIVE_ACTIVITY'; app: AppId }
  | null;
```

**Invariant:**
```ts
SystemSurfaceActivity.isAlive === (SystemSession !== null)
```

### Bootstrap State

Bootstrap state exists **only** to protect cold start.

```ts
type SessionBootstrapState = 'BOOTSTRAPPING' | 'READY';
```

- Initial state: `BOOTSTRAPPING`
- Exit condition: **JS finishes OS Trigger evaluation**

**Core Principle (Non‑Negotiable):**

> **SystemSurfaceActivity must survive long enough for JavaScript to decide whether a SystemSession exists.**

During cold start:
- `session === null` does **NOT** mean "finish immediately"
- it means **"decision not made yet"**

### Cold Start Timeline

```
t0  User opens Instagram
t1  Android OS switches foreground app → Instagram
t2  AccessibilityService still alive
t3  AccessibilityService detects monitored app
t4  Native emits MECHANICAL event: "FOREGROUND_CHANGED" to System Brain JS
t5  System Brain JS (headless task) receives event
t6  System Brain JS loads state from AsyncStorage
t7  System Brain JS calls Decision Engine (decideSystemSurfaceAction)
t8  Decision Engine evaluates priority chain:
    - Expired Quick Task check
    - OS Trigger Brain evaluation
    - Returns Decision (LAUNCH with wakeReason OR NONE)
t9  IF Decision.type === 'LAUNCH':
    → System Brain JS calls launchSystemSurface(app, wakeReason)
t10 Native launches SystemSurfaceActivity with wakeReason + triggeringApp
t11 Android creates NEW Activity + NEW RN Context
t12 React Native initializes
t13 SystemSurfaceRoot first render
    - session = null
    - bootstrapState = BOOTSTRAPPING
    - ❌ MUST NOT finish
t14 JS reads from native:
    - wakeReason (already determined by Decision Engine)
    - triggeringApp
t15 SystemSurface JS directly dispatches session based on wakeReason:
    - SHOW_QUICK_TASK_DIALOG → START_QUICK_TASK
    - START_INTERVENTION_FLOW → START_INTERVENTION
    - (NO re-evaluation, wakeReason IS the decision)
t16 JS sets bootstrapState = READY
t17 SystemSurfaceRoot renders again
    - If session !== null → render corresponding Flow
    - If session === null → finish SystemSurfaceActivity
```

**Key Changes (Decision Engine Refactor):**
- Decision Engine runs in **System Brain JS** (headless task), NOT in SystemSurface context
- Wake reason is pre-decided BEFORE SystemSurface is launched
- SystemSurface just consumes wake reason, no re-evaluation
- This ensures single authority and eliminates race conditions

**Critical Architectural Assumption:**

SystemSurfaceRoot bootstrap runs exactly once per Activity instance.

- SystemSurfaceActivity is disposable and never reused.
- Each launch is a cold start with fresh intent extras.
- We do NOT support intent re-delivery or Activity reuse.

**If this assumption changes in the future, bootstrap logic must be revisited.**

### SystemSurfaceRoot — Authoritative Logic

```tsx
function SystemSurfaceRoot() {
  const { session, bootstrapState } = useSystemSession();

  if (bootstrapState === 'BOOTSTRAPPING') {
    // Cold start phase — NEVER finish here
    return null;
  }

  if (session === null) {
    // Decision complete, no session needed
    finishSystemSurfaceActivity();
    return null;
  }

  switch (session.kind) {
    case 'INTERVENTION':
      return <InterventionFlow app={session.app} />;

    case 'QUICK_TASK':
      return <QuickTaskFlow app={session.app} />;

    case 'ALTERNATIVE_ACTIVITY':
      return <AlternativeActivityFlow app={session.app} />;
  }
}
```

### Context Ownership Rules

**JavaScript (SystemSurface Context) MUST:**
- Read wake reason from Intent extras (pre-decided by Decision Engine)
- Dispatch session based on wake reason (no logic, no re-evaluation)
- Dispatch START_* events
- Control bootstrap lifecycle

**JavaScript (SystemSurface Context) MUST NOT:**
- Run OS Trigger Brain or Decision Engine (already done in System Brain)
- Decide whether to create SystemSession (wake reason IS the decision)
- Re-evaluate priority chain
- Assume session exists on mount
- Finish activity during BOOTSTRAPPING

**JavaScript (MainApp Context) MUST:**
- Request native wake only

**JavaScript (MainApp Context) MUST NOT:**
- Create or modify SystemSession
- Dispatch START_* events

**Native (Kotlin) MUST:**
- Wake SystemSurfaceActivity
- Pass wakeReason + triggeringApp

**Native (Kotlin) MUST NOT:**
- Create session
- Interpret session
- Manage bootstrap

### Bootstrap Failure Modes

| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|-----------|
| App returns to Home immediately | finish() called during BOOTSTRAPPING |
| App hangs with no UI | Session created in MainApp context |
| No intervention shows | OS Trigger Brain not run in SystemSurface |
| Infinite loading | bootstrap never set to READY |

**Final Lock Rule:**

> **SystemSurfaceActivity may only finish after JavaScript has explicitly completed one OS Trigger evaluation cycle.**

---

## Part 1B: Final Responsibility Split (Phase 2 - Stable Architecture)

This section defines the **final, stable architecture** after Phase 2 completion. This is not a transition state.

### Native Layer (Android/Kotlin)

**Responsibilities:**
- Detect foreground app changes (AccessibilityService)
- Detect timer expirations (using persisted timestamps)
- Emit **mechanical events only**: `"TIMER_EXPIRED"`, `"FOREGROUND_CHANGED"`
- Launch SystemSurfaceActivity when requested by System Brain
- Pass wake reason via Intent extras

**Explicitly Forbidden:**
- ❌ Semantic decisions (Quick Task vs Intervention)
- ❌ Knowing about Quick Task / Intervention logic
- ❌ Launching SystemSurface directly based on app type
- ❌ Checking `n_quickTask` or `t_intention`
- ❌ Labeling events with semantic meaning
- ❌ Running OS Trigger Brain logic

**Key Rule:**
> **Native decides WHEN, never WHY**

---

### System Brain JS (Headless, Semantic Core)

**Responsibilities:**
- **Single semantic authority** for all intervention logic
- Owns all decision logic via **Decision Engine** (`src/systemBrain/decisionEngine.ts`)
- Decision Engine is the **ONLY** place where SystemSurface launch decisions are made
- Owns all decision logic:
  - **Monitored vs unmonitored apps** (via `isMonitoredApp()` from `src/os/osConfig.ts`)
  - Quick Task availability (n_quickTask quota)
  - Intervention triggering (OS Trigger Brain evaluation)
  - Suppression rules (t_intention, t_quickTask)
  - Quick Task expiration handling (foreground vs background)
- Owns all persistent semantic state (AsyncStorage)
- **Pre-decides UI flow** before launching SystemSurface
- Launches SystemSurface with **explicit wake reason**
- **Monitored App Guard**: MUST check `isMonitoredApp()` before any evaluation

**Decision Engine (`decideSystemSurfaceAction()`):**
- **Architectural Invariant**: This is the ONLY place where SystemSurface launch decisions are made
- Unifies Quick Task expiration + OS Trigger Brain into single priority chain
- Called ONLY from UI-safe boundaries (USER_INTERACTION, FOREGROUND_CHANGED)
- NEVER called from TIMER_EXPIRED (background event, not UI-safe)
- Returns `Decision` type: `NONE` or `LAUNCH` with app + wakeReason

**Event Handlers (State Updates Only):**
- `handleTimerExpiration()`: Updates state ONLY, marks expired timers, **NEVER** calls decision engine
- `handleUserInteraction()`: Updates state + calls decision engine (UI-safe boundary)
- `handleForegroundChange()`: Updates state + calls decision engine (UI-safe boundary)

**Guarantees:**
- **Kill-safe**: State persisted in AsyncStorage, logic reconstructable on each event
- **Idempotent**: Same inputs → same decision
- **Event-driven**: Invoked by native events, not continuously running
- **No in-memory state**: Loads/saves state on each invocation
- **Single decision per event**: Decision engine called at most once per event
- **UI-safe boundaries only**: Timer expiration never triggers UI directly

**Key Rule:**
> **System Brain decides WHY and WHAT UI to show. Decision Engine is the single authority.**

**Critical Guard Rule:**
> **OS Trigger Brain logic runs ONLY for monitored apps. System Brain MUST check `isMonitoredApp(packageName)` before Quick Task evaluation or Intervention evaluation. BreakLoop app itself is explicitly excluded.**

**UI-Safe Boundaries Rule:**
> **Timer expiration events are NOT UI-safe. They update state only. UI decisions are made only at UI-safe boundaries (user interaction or foreground change).**

---

### SystemSurface JS (UI Runtime)

**Responsibilities:**
- Render UI only (intervention screens, Quick Task dialog)
- Consume wake reasons from System Brain (declarative instructions)
- Dispatch exactly one session per launch based on wake reason
- Handle user interactions
- Report decisions back to System Brain
- Manage bootstrap lifecycle (BOOTSTRAPPING → READY)

**Explicitly Forbidden:**
- ❌ Semantic decisions (Quick Task vs Intervention)
- ❌ Availability checks (n_quickTask, t_intention)
- ❌ Reading System Brain internal state from AsyncStorage
- ❌ Re-running OS Trigger Brain logic
- ❌ Calling `evaluateTriggerLogic()`
- ❌ Using setTimeout for semantic timers
- ❌ Re-evaluating priority chain

**Key Rule:**
> **SystemSurface never thinks, it only renders. Wake reasons are declarative instructions, not triggers for re-evaluation.**

---

### Main App JS (User Features)

**Responsibilities:**
- Settings UI
- Community features
- Insights and statistics display
- User-initiated navigation

**Explicitly Excluded From:**
- ❌ System-level intervention logic
- ❌ Quick Task execution
- ❌ Intervention triggering
- ❌ Timer expiration handling
- ❌ Foreground app monitoring
- ❌ Creating SystemSession

**Key Rule:**
> **Main App is for user features only, never system logic**

---

## Part 2: Native–JavaScript Boundary

### Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

**Native code decides WHEN to wake the app.**  
**JavaScript decides WHAT the user sees and WHY.**

- **Native = mechanics**
- **JavaScript = semantics**

### Three JavaScript Runtimes

BreakLoop uses THREE distinct JavaScript runtimes:

1. **System Brain JS** - Event-driven, headless, semantic logic (NEW)
2. **SystemSurface JS** - Ephemeral, UI-only, intervention screens
3. **MainApp JS** - User-initiated, settings and community

### System Brain JS (Event-Driven Semantic Runtime)

**Definition:**
System Brain JS is an **event-driven, headless JavaScript runtime** that runs as a React Native Headless JS task.

**Lifecycle (CRITICAL):**
- Invoked by native when mechanical events occur
- Recomputes state deterministically on each invocation
- Does NOT rely on continuous execution
- Does NOT maintain in-memory state between invocations
- Must load/save state from persistent storage on each event

**Responsibilities:**
- Receive MECHANICAL events from native (timer expired, foreground changed)
- Classify semantic meaning (Quick Task vs Intention vs other)
- Evaluate OS Trigger Brain logic
- Decide when to launch SystemSurface
- Maintain semantic state (t_quickTask, t_intention)
- Persist/restore state on each invocation

**Forbidden:**
- UI rendering
- React components
- Depending on SystemSurface or MainApp contexts
- Assuming continuous execution
- Maintaining state in memory between events

### Native (Kotlin) — Allowed Responsibilities

**Native Code MAY:**
- Detect foreground app changes (AccessibilityService)
- Detect timer expiration using persisted timestamps
- Persist timestamps (SharedPreferences)
- Emit MECHANICAL events: "timer expired for app X", "foreground is app X"
- Launch SystemSurfaceActivity when requested by System Brain

**Native Code MUST NOT:**
- Decide Quick Task vs Intervention
- Check `n_quickTask`
- Check `t_intention` priority
- Run OS Trigger priority chain
- Decide which screen to show
- Interpret user intent
- Navigate inside flows
- Label events with semantic meaning (no "QuickTaskExpired", "IntentionExpired")

### JavaScript — Required Responsibilities

**System Brain JS MUST:**
- Own the Decision Engine (`decideSystemSurfaceAction()`)
- Decision Engine is the ONLY place where launch decisions are made
- Decision Engine unifies Quick Task expiration + OS Trigger Brain priority chain
- Evaluate the full priority chain (via Decision Engine)
- Classify timer type (Quick Task vs Intention)
- Decide:
  - Quick Task Flow
  - Intervention Flow
  - Suppression (do nothing)
- Manage `t_intention` semantics
- Manage Quick Task semantics
- Reset timers on Quick Task expiry
- Load/save state on each event invocation
- **Call Decision Engine ONLY from UI-safe boundaries** (USER_INTERACTION, FOREGROUND_CHANGED)
- **NEVER call Decision Engine from TIMER_EXPIRED** (background event, not UI-safe)

**SystemSurface JS MUST:**
- Render intervention screens
- Handle user interactions
- Report decisions to System Brain

**SystemSurface JS MUST NOT:**
- Use setTimeout for semantic timers
- Decide whether to intervene
- Maintain persistent state

**MainApp JS MUST:**
- Handle user-initiated features (settings, community)

**MainApp JS MUST NOT:**
- Handle system-level intervention logic
- Handle timer expiration
- Monitor foreground apps

### Wake Reason Contract (Critical - Final Form)

Every native launch of `SystemSurfaceActivity` MUST include a wake reason.

**Core Principle:**
> **Wake reasons are declarative instructions, not triggers for re-evaluation.**

System Brain pre-decides the UI flow. SystemSurface consumes the wake reason and renders accordingly.

---

**Valid Wake Reasons (Phase 2 - Explicit Pre-Decision):**

1. **`SHOW_QUICK_TASK_DIALOG`**
   - **Meaning**: System Brain evaluated priority chain → User is eligible for Quick Task
   - **SystemSurface Action**: Dispatch `START_QUICK_TASK` session
   - **UI**: Show Quick Task dialog

2. **`START_INTERVENTION_FLOW`**
   - **Meaning**: System Brain evaluated priority chain → Intervention must start
   - **SystemSurface Action**: Dispatch `START_INTERVENTION` session
   - **UI**: Show Intervention flow (breathing screen)

3. **`QUICK_TASK_EXPIRED_FOREGROUND`**
   - **Meaning**: Quick Task timer expired while user stayed in app
   - **SystemSurface Action**: Dispatch `START_INTERVENTION` session
   - **UI**: Show QuickTaskExpiredScreen → Intervention

4. **`DEV_DEBUG`**
   - **Meaning**: Developer-triggered wake for testing
   - **SystemSurface Action**: Depends on test scenario
   - **UI**: Varies (testing only)

---

**Deprecated Wake Reasons (Phase 1 - Transitional):**
- ~~`MONITORED_APP_FOREGROUND`~~ - Ambiguous, replaced by explicit wake reasons above
- ~~`INTENTION_EXPIRED_FOREGROUND`~~ - Now handled by System Brain event classification

---

**System Brain JS Requirements:**
- Receive mechanical events from native: `"TIMER_EXPIRED"`, `"FOREGROUND_CHANGED"`
- **Check `isMonitoredApp(packageName)`** before any evaluation (Monitored App Guard)
- Classify semantic meaning (Quick Task vs Intention)
- **Evaluate OS Trigger Brain priority chain**
- **Pre-decide UI flow** (Quick Task OR Intervention)
- Launch SystemSurface with **explicit wake reason**

**SystemSurface JS Requirements:**
- Read wake reason from Intent extras on startup
- **Directly dispatch session based on wake reason** (no logic, no re-evaluation)
- **NEVER** call `evaluateTriggerLogic()` (System Brain already decided)
- **NEVER** re-evaluate OS Trigger Brain priority chain
- **NEVER** read AsyncStorage semantic state
- **NEVER** use setTimeout for semantic timers

### Red Flags (Immediate Failure)

If **ANY** of the following are true, **STOP and FIX**:

- ❌ Kotlin code checks `n_quickTask`
- ❌ Kotlin code chooses Quick Task vs Intervention
- ❌ Kotlin code decides navigation or screens
- ❌ Kotlin code labels events with semantic meaning
- ❌ System Brain JS skips priority chain based on native assumptions
- ❌ SystemSurface JS uses setTimeout for semantic timers
- ❌ `QUICK_TASK_EXPIRED_FOREGROUND` triggers Quick Task dialog again
- ❌ Main app UI appears in System Surface
- ❌ Native logic duplicates JS logic
- ❌ Semantic logic in SystemSurface or MainApp contexts
- ❌ Decision Engine called from TIMER_EXPIRED (background event, not UI-safe)
- ❌ `launchSystemSurface()` called directly without Decision Engine
- ❌ Event handlers contain decision logic (they should only update state)

## Part 2B: Single Source of Truth for State

This table defines **where each piece of state lives** and **who owns it**. This is the authoritative reference for state management.

| State | Owner | Storage Location | Storage Key | Scope | Notes |
|-------|-------|------------------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **n_quickTask** (max uses) | System Brain | AsyncStorage | `quick_task_settings_v1` | Global | User config from Settings, immutable at runtime |
| **Quick Task usage history** | System Brain | AsyncStorage | `system_brain_state_v1` | Global | Array of timestamps, kill-safe, cleaned on each event |
| **t_quickTask** (timer) | System Brain | AsyncStorage | `system_brain_state_v1` | Per-app | Quick Task active timer per monitored app |
| **t_intention** (timer) | System Brain | AsyncStorage | `system_brain_state_v1` | Per-app | Intention timer per monitored app |
| **Monitored apps list** | Main App | AsyncStorage | `mindful_*_v17_2` | Global | User-configured list, read by System Brain via `isMonitoredApp()` |
| **SystemSession** | SystemSurface | In-memory | N/A | UI only | Ephemeral, destroyed when SystemSurface finishes |
| **Bootstrap state** | SystemSurface | In-memory | N/A | UI only | BOOTSTRAPPING → READY lifecycle |
| **Intervention state** | SystemSurface | In-memory | N/A | UI only | Breathing, root-cause, alternatives, etc. |

---

**Hard Rules:**

1. **SystemSurface may NOT read or infer semantic state from AsyncStorage**
   - SystemSurface receives all decisions via wake reason
   - No direct AsyncStorage reads for `n_quickTask`, `t_intention`, etc.

2. **System Brain is the ONLY writer of semantic state**
   - Only System Brain writes to `system_brain_state_v1`
   - Only System Brain updates usage history and timers

3. **State must be kill-safe**
   - System Brain loads state on each event invocation
   - No reliance on in-memory state between events

4. **Monitored App Guard**
   - System Brain MUST call `isMonitoredApp(packageName)` before any evaluation
   - BreakLoop app itself is explicitly excluded from monitoring

---

## Part 2C: Canonical Event Flow (Phase 2 - Final)

This is the **single, authoritative event flow** for Phase 2. There are no alternative paths or legacy flows.

```

**Key Principles:**

1. **Linear Flow**: Native → System Brain → SystemSurface (no loops)
2. **Single Authority**: Decision Engine is the ONLY place where launch decisions are made
3. **UI-Safe Boundaries**: Decision Engine called only from user interaction events, never from timer expiration
4. **Single Evaluation**: Decision Engine evaluated once per event, unifies Quick Task + OS Trigger Brain
5. **State Updates First**: Event handlers update state, then call Decision Engine (if UI-safe)
6. **Explicit Wake Reasons**: Wake reason IS the decision (no ambiguity)
7. **Monitored App Guard**: System Brain checks `isMonitoredApp()` before evaluation
8. **No Re-Evaluation**: SystemSurface never re-runs priority chain

**What This Diagram Does NOT Show:**

- ❌ Alternative paths (there are none)
- ❌ Legacy flows (Phase 1 is deprecated)
- ❌ SystemSurface decision logic (it has none)
- ❌ Native semantic decisions (it makes none)

## Part 3: OS Trigger Contract

### Monitored Apps Definition

**What counts as a "monitored app":**
- Apps and Websites listed under Settings → "Monitored apps"
- Both applications and websites are monitored and will trigger the conscious process intervention
- Each monitored app/website is treated as an individual entity

### Timer/Parameter Scope

Each individual monitored app shall have its own timers/parameters below, **except** `n_quickTasks` which is global:

| Timer/Parameter | Scope | Notes |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| `t_intention` | Per-app | Each monitored app has its own intention timer |
| `t_quickTask` | Per-app | Each monitored app has its own Quick Task active timer |
| `n_quickTask` | **GLOBAL** | Usage count is shared - using Quick Task on Instagram consumes quota for TikTok too |

### Intervention Trigger Rules

**Core Principle:** Every app shall be treated as individual.

**Evaluation Rule:**
- Every time a monitored app enters foreground, the OS trigger logic must evaluate whether an intervention should start.

**Suppression Conditions:**

When the intervention for a monitored app has already been started, the system must monitor:

- If the intention timer (`t_intention`) is chosen and `t_intention` is not over, **OR**
- If the "alternative activity" is started,  
- **Then:** the intervention shall NOT be started.

**Else:** the intervention shall be started from the beginning again.

### Intention Timer (`t_intention`) Behavior

**Definition:** The timer set by the user for this monitored app during the intervention flow indicating how long the user wants to use this app.

**Rules:**
- When `t_intention` is over and the user is still using this monitored app, the intervention should start again.
- Every time the intervention flow starts or restarts, the `t_intention` for this app shall be deleted.

### Incomplete Intervention Cancellation

When user switches away from a monitored app, cancel intervention ONLY if it's incomplete.

**Incomplete States (Cancel Intervention):**
- **`breathing`** - User hasn't finished breathing
- **`root-cause`** - User hasn't selected causes
- **`alternatives`** - User hasn't chosen alternative
- **`action`** - User hasn't started activity
- **`reflection`** - User hasn't finished reflection

**Complete/Preserved States (Do NOT Cancel):**
- **`action_timer`** - User is doing alternative activity → preserve
- **`timer`** - User set `t_intention` → this transitions to idle AND launches the app, so user can use it normally → preserve
- **`idle`** - No intervention → nothing to cancel

**Key Insight:** When user sets `t_intention`, the intervention completes and transitions to `idle`, then the app launches normally. The `t_intention` timer is now active and will suppress future interventions until it expires.

### Quick Task System

**Definitions:**
- **`t_quickTask`**: Duration of the emergency allowance
- **`n_quickTask`**: Number of Quick Tasks allowed within the rolling window (e.g., 15 minutes)

**Rules:**
1. **Quick Task temporarily suppresses all intervention triggers.**
2. **During `t_quickTask`:**
   - User may freely switch apps and return to monitored apps
   - No intervention process shall start
3. **Quick Task does NOT create or extend `t_intention`.**
4. **When `t_quickTask` expires:**
   - `t_intention` is reset to 0
   - System shows the screen "QuickTaskExpiredScreen"
   - User will press the button and leave to the home screen of the cellphone
5. **After Quick Task expiry:**
   - The next opening of a monitored app triggers:
     - the intervention process, OR
     - the Quick Task dialog (if `n_quickTask` allows)
6. **No timer state from before the Quick Task is resumed or reused.**
7. **`n_quickTask` is counted globally across all monitored apps within the window.**

**Quick Task Rules:**
1. ✅ Each app has its own independent Quick Task timer (t_quickTask is per-app)
2. ✅ During Quick Task: User can use THAT SPECIFIC APP without intervention
3. ✅ Switching to a DIFFERENT monitored app will trigger its own intervention check
4. ✅ Does NOT create or extend t_monitored
5. ✅ On expiry: Show dedicated screen, reset timers, go to Home
6. ✅ No timer state from before Quick Task is resumed
7. ✅ n_quickTask (usage count) is GLOBAL across all monitored apps

**Intervention Rules:**
1. ✅ Each monitored app has independent intervention state
2. ✅ IntentionTimer sets t_intention (per-app)
3. ✅ ActionTimer suppresses interventions while alternative activity runs
4. ✅ After intervention: User returns to monitored app
5. ✅ t_intention blocks future interventions until it expires

---

### Intervention Flow Initialization Contract

**Critical Rule:** `BEGIN_INTERVENTION` must be dispatched **idempotently** to prevent countdown/hang bugs.

**Initialization Condition:**

`BEGIN_INTERVENTION` should be dispatched when:
- `targetApp` changes (switching to a different monitored app), OR
- Intervention state is NOT already in `breathing`

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// CORRECT (Idempotent)
useEffect(() => {
  if (interventionState.targetApp !== triggeringApp || 
      interventionState.state !== 'breathing') {
    dispatchIntervention({
      type: 'BEGIN_INTERVENTION',
      targetApp: triggeringApp,
    });
  }
}, [triggeringApp, interventionState.targetApp, interventionState.state]);

// WRONG (Unconditional reset)
useEffect(() => {
  dispatchIntervention({
    type: 'BEGIN_INTERVENTION',
    targetApp: triggeringApp,
  });
}, [triggeringApp]); // ❌ Resets on every mount, causes countdown restart
```

**Forbidden Patterns:**
- ❌ Unconditional reset on component mount
- ❌ Relying on previous reducer state accidentally
- ❌ Multiple `BEGIN_INTERVENTION` dispatches for same app

**Why This Matters:**

Without idempotent initialization:
- Breathing countdown restarts unexpectedly
- User sees screen hang or flicker
- Intervention state becomes inconsistent

**Verification:**

When reviewing intervention initialization code:
- [ ] Check if `BEGIN_INTERVENTION` is conditional
- [ ] Verify `targetApp` comparison
- [ ] Verify `state !== 'breathing'` check
- [ ] Ensure no unconditional dispatch on mount

```

**Key Principles:**
1. ✅ ONE shared OS-level activity (see `SystemSurface Lifecycle Contract (Authoritative).md` - Invariant 1)
2. ✅ THREE distinct states (BOOTSTRAPPING, ACTIVE SESSION, NO SESSION)
3. ✅ Multiple separate, mutually exclusive flows (Quick Task, Intervention, Alternative Activity)
4. ✅ Flows share infrastructure, not semantics
5. ✅ Only ONE flow active at any time (when session exists)
6. ✅ Bootstrap state protects against premature finish()
7. ✅ Main app UI never appears in System Surface
8. ✅ **Lifecycle contract compliance** - All state transitions must follow allowed paths (see `SystemSurface Lifecycle Contract (Authoritative).md`)

## Why This Architecture?

### Why Flows are Separate

**Quick Task Flow:**
- Emergency bypass mechanism
- Short-lived (minutes)
- Global scope
- No intervention screens
- No conscious process
- Ends with explicit boundary (Home)

**Intervention Flow:**
- Full mindfulness process
- User-driven duration
- Per-app scope
- Multi-screen journey
- Conscious decision-making
- Ends with return to monitored app

**They solve different problems and must not be mixed.**

### Why They Share the OS Surface

**Practical Reasons:**
1. Both need to appear on top of other apps
2. Both need full-screen takeover
3. Both need OS-level permissions
4. Sharing infrastructure reduces complexity

**Architectural Reasons:**
1. The surface is neutral - it doesn't care which flow renders
2. Only ONE flow is ever active
3. Native code doesn't need to understand flow semantics
4. JavaScript decides which flow to show

### Why Quick Task is NOT Part of Intervention

**Conceptual Separation:**
- Quick Task is a **gate** that prevents intervention
- Intervention is a **process** that happens after the gate
- Gates and processes are not nested - they're sequential

**Implementation Impact:**
- Quick Task can bypass intervention entirely
- Quick Task doesn't create intervention state
- Quick Task doesn't extend intervention timers
- Quick Task and Intervention have independent lifecycles

**User Mental Model:**
- "I need this urgently" (Quick Task) vs "Let me think about this" (Intervention)
- Emergency vs Consciousness
- Bypass vs Engage

---

## Priority Chain (LOCKED)

This order is **AUTHORITATIVE** and must never change:

```
1. Quick Task ACTIVE (per-app: t_quickTask)
   → Suppress everything for this app

2. Alternative Activity RUNNING (per-app)
   → Suppress everything for this app

3. t_intention VALID (per-app)
   → Suppress everything for this app
   → Quick Task dialog MUST NOT appear

4. n_quickTask > 0 (global usage count)
   → Show Quick Task dialog

5. Else
   → Start Intervention Flow
```

**Important Distinctions:**
- **t_quickTask** (timer): PER-APP - Each app has its own independent Quick Task timer
- **n_quickTask** (usage count): GLOBAL - Shared quota across all monitored apps

**Rationale for Order:**

1. **Quick Task ACTIVE first** - This app has an active timer, user can use it freely
2. **Alternative Activity second** - User is actively doing something else
3. **t_intention third** - User made an explicit conscious decision for this app
4. **Quick Task availability fourth** - Emergency bypass option (global quota check)
5. **Intervention last** - Default path when no other conditions apply

### Logic Between `t_intention`, `t_quickTask`, `n_quickTasks`

When a monitored app enters foreground, evaluate in this order:

**Step 1: Check `t_intention` for this opening monitored app**

**If `t_intention != 0`:**
- No Quick Task dialog
- No intervention
- **SUPPRESS everything**

**If `t_intention = 0`:**
- Proceed to Step 2

**Step 2: Check `n_quickTasks` (global count)**

**If `n_quickTasks != 0`:**
- Proceed to Step 3

**If `n_quickTasks = 0`:**
- No Quick Task dialog
- **START INTERVENTION**

**Step 3: Check `t_quickTask` for this app**

**If `t_quickTask != 0`:**
- No Quick Task dialog
- No intervention
- **SUPPRESS (Quick Task active)**

**If `t_quickTask = 0` or has no value:**
- **SHOW QUICK TASK DIALOG**

### Decision Tree Summary

```
Monitored App Enters Foreground
    ↓
Check t_intention for this app
    ↓
[t_intention != 0?] ─YES→ SUPPRESS (no Quick Task, no intervention)
    ↓ NO (t_intention = 0)
Check n_quickTask (global)
    ↓
[n_quickTask != 0?]
    ↓ YES
    Check t_quickTask for this app
        ↓
    [t_quickTask != 0?] ─YES→ SUPPRESS (no Quick Task, no intervention)
        ↓ NO (t_quickTask = 0)
    SHOW QUICK TASK DIALOG
    ↓ NO (n_quickTask = 0)
START INTERVENTION FLOW
(delete t_intention for this app)
```

### Key Principles

1. **Per-App Isolation:** Each monitored app has its own `t_intention` and `t_quickTask` timers. Instagram's timers don't affect TikTok's behavior.

2. **Global Quick Task Quota:** `n_quickTask` is shared across all monitored apps. Using Quick Task on one app consumes the quota for all apps.

3. **Intervention Reset:** Every time intervention starts or restarts, `t_intention` for that app is deleted.

4. **Intention Timer Expiry:** When `t_intention` expires while user is still in the app, intervention starts again.

5. **Quick Task Independence:** Quick Task does NOT create or extend `t_intention`. They are separate mechanisms.

6. **Incomplete Cancellation:** Only cancel intervention when user switches away in incomplete states (breathing, root-cause, alternatives, action, reflection).

7. **Complete Preservation:** Preserve intervention state when user sets `t_intention` (transitions to idle) or starts alternative activity (action_timer state).

## Decision Authority

**Native Code (ForegroundDetectionService):**
- ✅ Detects foreground app changes
- ✅ Detects timer expirations
- ✅ Emits mechanical events to System Brain JS
- ❌ Does NOT decide which flow to show
- ❌ Does NOT interpret timers or states
- ❌ Does NOT label events with semantic meaning

**System Brain JS (Event-Driven Headless Runtime):**
- ✅ Receives mechanical events from native
- ✅ Decision Engine (`decideSystemSurfaceAction()`) is the single authority for launch decisions
- ✅ Event handlers update state, then call Decision Engine (if UI-safe boundary)
- ✅ `handleTimerExpiration()`: Updates state only, NEVER calls Decision Engine
- ✅ Decision Engine unifies Quick Task expiration + OS Trigger Brain priority chain
- ✅ Classifies semantic meaning (Quick Task vs Intention)
- ✅ Evaluates priority chain via Decision Engine
- ✅ Checks all timers and states
- ✅ Decides which flow to show (via Decision Engine)
- ✅ Requests SystemSurface launch from native (if Decision Engine returns LAUNCH)
- ✅ Single source of semantic truth
- ✅ Loads/saves state on each event invocation
- ✅ Decision Engine called ONLY from UI-safe boundaries (USER_INTERACTION, FOREGROUND_CHANGED)

**SystemSurface JS (Ephemeral UI):**
- ✅ Renders intervention screens
- ✅ Handles user interactions
- ✅ Reports decisions to System Brain
- ❌ Does NOT use setTimeout for semantic timers
- ❌ Does NOT decide whether to intervene

**MainApp JS (User-Initiated):**
- ✅ Settings and community features
- ❌ Does NOT handle system-level intervention logic

**Principle:** Native code is infrastructure. System Brain JS is semantics. SystemSurface/MainApp JS are UI.

## Future-Proofing

This architecture allows for:
- ✅ Adding new flows without changing native code
- ✅ Adding new priority conditions without changing infrastructure
- ✅ Testing flows independently
- ✅ Clear boundaries between concerns
- ✅ Easy mental model for developers

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Critical - Must Never Happen Again):**

These patterns have caused bugs in the past and must be explicitly avoided:

1. **❌ SystemSurface calling OS Trigger Brain logic**
   - SystemSurface must NEVER call `evaluateTriggerLogic()`
   - SystemSurface must NEVER re-evaluate priority chain
   - Wake reason IS the decision, no re-evaluation needed

2. **❌ UI computing Quick Task availability**
   - SystemSurface must NEVER check `n_quickTask`
   - SystemSurface must NEVER read `t_intention` or `t_quickTask`
   - All availability checks happen in System Brain only

3. **❌ UI reading AsyncStorage semantic state**
   - SystemSurface must NEVER read `system_brain_state_v1`
   - SystemSurface must NEVER read `quick_task_settings_v1`
   - SystemSurface receives all decisions via wake reason

4. **❌ Native launching SystemSurface based on app type**
   - Native must NEVER check if app is monitored
   - Native must NEVER decide Quick Task vs Intervention
   - Native emits mechanical events only

5. **❌ Multiple semantic authorities**
   - System Brain Decision Engine (`decideSystemSurfaceAction()`) is the ONLY place making launch decisions
   - No semantic logic in Native, SystemSurface, or MainApp
   - Single source of truth for all intervention decisions
   - Event handlers must NOT contain decision logic, only state updates

6. **❌ Nesting Quick Task inside Intervention Flow**
   - Quick Task and Intervention are separate, mutually exclusive flows
   - Never show Quick Task dialog during intervention
   - Never mix flow states

7. **❌ Making native code interpret semantic logic**
   - Native decides WHEN, never WHY
   - No semantic meaning in native event labels
   - No timer type classification in native

8. **❌ Mixing Main App UI with System Surface UI**
   - Main App and System Surface are separate contexts
   - Never show Main App screens in System Surface
   - Never show System Surface screens in Main App

9. **❌ Sharing state between flows**
   - Each flow has independent state
   - No state leakage between Quick Task and Intervention
   - Clean state on flow transition

10. **❌ Changing priority order without reviewing this document**
    - Priority chain order is LOCKED
    - Changes require architecture review
    - Must update all documentation

11. **❌ Unconditional BEGIN_INTERVENTION on mount**
    - Must check if already in breathing state
    - Must check if targetApp changed
    - Idempotent initialization only

12. **❌ Skipping Monitored App Guard**
    - System Brain MUST check `isMonitoredApp()` before evaluation
    - BreakLoop app itself must be excluded
    - No intervention for unmonitored apps

## Summary

1. **System Surface** = Neutral OS-level container
2. **Runtime Context** = THREE JS runtimes (System Brain, SystemSurface, MainApp)
3. **System Brain JS** = Event-driven, headless, semantic logic (NEW)
4. **Decision Engine** = Single authority for all SystemSurface launch decisions (`decideSystemSurfaceAction()`)
5. **UI-Safe Boundaries** = Decision Engine called only from user interaction events, never from timer expiration
6. **Event Handlers** = "Dumb" state updaters; call Decision Engine only at UI-safe boundaries
7. **Bootstrap Lifecycle** = BOOTSTRAPPING → READY (protects cold start)
8. **Native–JavaScript Boundary** = Native emits MECHANICAL events, System Brain classifies SEMANTIC meaning
9. **Wake Reason Contract** = System Brain Decision Engine pre-decides, then launches SystemSurface with wake reason
10. **Quick Task Flow** = Emergency bypass (global quota, per-app timer)
11. **Intervention Flow** = Conscious process (per-app)
12. **Flows are separate** = Different purposes, different scopes
13. **Priority chain is locked** = Unified in Decision Engine (Quick Task expiration + OS Trigger Brain)
14. **System Brain decides** = Native emits events, System Brain Decision Engine decides, SystemSurface renders

**This is the canonical model. All implementation must follow this.**
