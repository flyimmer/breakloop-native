# Git Reminders

This directory contains reminder files for common workflows and gotchas.

**These files are committed to git** so they persist across chat sessions and can be referenced by:
- AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Human developers
- CI/CD systems

## Current Reminders

- `KOTLIN_FILES.md` - Workflow for Kotlin file changes

## Usage

When starting a new task, check relevant reminder files first!
