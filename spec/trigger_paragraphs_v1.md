# BreakLoop — Trigger “Why scrolling won’t help” Copy (v1)

UI-ready paragraphs for the **WHY** step (F4b).  
Each trigger has:
- **Long**: shown the **first time** in a run (or first few uses)
- **Short**: shown on **repeat** visits (CP4+ / later checkpoints)

## Boredom

**Long (first time)**  
Boredom is not an enemy — it’s your brain’s **engine for exploration, learning, and improvement**. The phone offers a superficial cure: quick novelty that feels like stimulation, but it trains a habit loop — **bored → check phone → novelty reward → stronger urge next time**. Over time you lose the very trigger that pushes you to create, learn, or move your life forward, and boredom gets worse because your tolerance gets weaker. If you stop now, boredom can do its real job: point you toward something meaningful.

**Short (repeat)**  
Boredom is fuel for growth — scrolling turns it into a “check phone” habit and makes boredom worse.

## Stress/Anxiety

**Long (first time)**  
Stress/Anxiety is a useful signal: **something needs attention, rest, or a boundary**. Scrolling feels like relief, but it usually adds stimulation (noise, comparison, endless input), so your nervous system stays “on.” That creates a trap: **stress → phone escape → no real coping → more stress later**, and you become more dependent on the phone as a pacifier. If you leave now, stress can guide a real reset instead of being postponed.

**Short (repeat)**  
Stress/Anxiety needs downshifting — scrolling keeps your system “on” and makes stress stick.

## Loneliness

**Long (first time)**  
Loneliness is your social system saying: **you need real connection**. Feeds can imitate connection, but often deliver the opposite: passive watching, comparison, and tiny hits of validation that fade fast. The loop becomes: **lonely → scroll → pseudo-connection → emptier → scroll more**. Exiting now creates space for contact that actually satisfies loneliness — even a small real reach-out beats another scroll.

**Short (repeat)**  
Feeds imitate connection — real contact fixes loneliness. Scrolling usually deepens it.

## Fatigue (tired / low energy)

**Long (first time)**  
Fatigue is your body’s message: **you need recovery** — sleep, a pause, less input. The phone can feel like a quick “boost,” but it’s borrowed energy: bright light, novelty, and constant stimulation keep your brain awake while your body is tired. That builds a loop: **tired → scroll for a lift → sleep gets worse / rest delayed → more tired tomorrow**, and the urge to scroll becomes stronger because real recovery is missing. If you stop now, fatigue can do its job: push you toward rest that actually restores you.

**Short (repeat)**  
Fatigue needs recovery — scrolling steals it and makes you more tired later.

## Self-doubt (insecure / not good enough)

**Long (first time)**  
Self-doubt isn’t “proof you’re failing” — it’s often the sign you’re at the edge of growth, needing reassurance, practice, or a kinder standard. The phone offers the worst substitute: comparison and external validation. Scrolling turns doubt into a loop: **insecure → check feed → compare / seek reassurance → feel worse → check again**. Instead of building confidence through action, you outsource your worth to the next post, message, or metric. Leaving now breaks the comparison loop and gives you a chance to choose one small real step that strengthens confidence.

**Short (repeat)**  
Self-doubt grows on comparison — scrolling feeds it. Small real action builds confidence.

## No clear goal (aimless / “I don’t know what to do”)

**Long (first time)**  
Feeling directionless is a signal, not a defect: your mind is asking for **a choice** — even a small one. The phone makes aimlessness easy to avoid by giving you endless ready-made goals (more content, more updates) so you never have to decide. That creates a loop: **unclear → scroll to avoid choosing → time disappears → even less clarity**. When you stop scrolling, you regain the space to pick a direction: one intention, one next step, one priority. Clarity comes from choosing, not consuming.

**Short (repeat)**  
No clear goal is a cue to choose — scrolling postpones the choice and steals clarity.
