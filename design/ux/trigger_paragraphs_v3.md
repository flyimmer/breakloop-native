# BreakLoop — WHY Copy (v3: Support + Alternatives)

This replaces the **Long/Short WHY** format from v2 fileciteturn12file0.

## What changed
- **Intervention default path:** no WHY.
- **Intervention support path (opt‑in):** show **Micro‑WHY** only (1 sentence + 2 bullets).
- **Alternatives tab (Group by = Triggers):**
  - show a **Collapsed 1‑liner** under each trigger header
  - tap to expand → show the same **Micro‑WHY**

---

## Boredom

### Collapsed 1‑liner (Alternatives header)
Boredom is your brain asking to explore — scrolling numbs it.

### Micro‑WHY (Support + Expanded header)
Boredom is the engine for exploration and growth — feeds only give quick novelty.
- Novelty rewards train a habit loop: bored → check phone → stronger urge next time.
- When you stop, boredom points you toward something meaningful to do.

---

## Stress / Anxiety

### Collapsed 1‑liner (Alternatives header)
Stress wants a reset — scrolling keeps your nervous system “on”.

### Micro‑WHY (Support + Expanded header)
Stress is a signal to downshift or set a boundary — scrolling adds noise and stimulation.
- More input keeps your body activated, so anxiety doesn’t actually resolve.
- A small real reset (breath, walk, message, task) reduces stress faster than a feed.

---

## Loneliness

### Collapsed 1‑liner (Alternatives header)
Feeds imitate connection — real contact heals loneliness.

### Micro‑WHY (Support + Expanded header)
Loneliness is your social system asking for real connection — scrolling is usually passive and empty.
- Comparison + “pseudo‑connection” can leave you feeling even more isolated.
- One small reach‑out beats another scroll: a message, voice note, or quick call.

---

## Fatigue (tired / low energy)

### Collapsed 1‑liner (Alternatives header)
Fatigue needs recovery — scrolling steals rest and sleep.

### Micro‑WHY (Support + Expanded header)
Fatigue is your body asking to recover — scrolling borrows energy with light and novelty.
- It delays rest and can worsen sleep quality, making tomorrow harder.
- A short recovery action (water, stretch, eyes closed, nap prep) restores more than a feed.

---

## Self‑doubt (insecure / not good enough)

### Collapsed 1‑liner (Alternatives header)
Self‑doubt grows on comparison — scrolling feeds it.

### Micro‑WHY (Support + Expanded header)
Self‑doubt often means you’re at the edge of growth — feeds turn it into comparison.
- Validation fades fast; comparison loops make you feel worse, not better.
- One tiny real step builds confidence: practice, tidy, message someone, write a plan.

---

## No clear goal (aimless / “what am I doing?”)

### Collapsed 1‑liner (Alternatives header)
No clear goal is a cue to choose — scrolling postpones clarity.

### Micro‑WHY (Support + Expanded header)
Aimlessness is your mind asking for a small decision — scrolling avoids the choice.
- The feed supplies endless “ready‑made goals,” so your own priorities stay unclear.
- Clarity comes from choosing one next step, not consuming more input.

---

## Other (custom)

### Collapsed 1‑liner (Alternatives header)
Not sure what it is? Name it once — then choose one small action.

### Micro‑WHY (Support + Expanded header)
If the feeling doesn’t fit the categories, that’s okay — naming it reduces its power.
- Give it a short label (e.g., “waiting”, “FOMO”, “work tension”) so you notice the pattern.
- Then pick one small action that matches what you actually need right now.

---

## Implementation notes (v1)
- **Support path:** after trigger selection, show Micro‑WHY + 3 actions:
  - “Open alternatives”
  - “Close app now”
  - “Set another timer”
- **Alternatives (Triggers grouping):**
  - show the **Collapsed 1‑liner** under each trigger header
  - tap header (or “Why this helps”) expands to Micro‑WHY
