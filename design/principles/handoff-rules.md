BreakLoop — Handoff Rules
Interruption UI ↔ Main App
________________________________________
0. Purpose
This document defines handoff rules between:
•	Interruption UI (conscious process, habit interruption)
•	Main App UI (insights, community, planning, settings)
Handoff rules exist to:
•	Prevent gravity rules from leaking into non-vulnerable contexts
•	Prevent main app richness from contaminating intervention moments
•	Make transitions psychologically clean and non-coercive

1. Definitions
Interruption UI
Screens where the user is:
•	Interrupted mid-habit
•	Vulnerable or time-pressured
•	Deciding whether and how to interrupt behavior
These screens are governed by:
•	interaction-gravity.md
Examples:
•	App interception
•	“Why Instagram?”
•	Breathing pause
•	Alternatives
•	Quick Task decision
•	Exit confirmations
________________________________________
Main App UI
Screens where the user is:
•	Reflective (retrospective)
•	Curious
•	Planning or coordinating
•	Social or administrative
These screens are not governed by interaction gravity.
Examples:
•	Insights & statistics
•	Community & activities
•	Planning & scheduling
•	Account & settings

2. The Core Handoff Rule (Authoritative)
Interaction gravity applies only while the user is deciding whether and how to interrupt a habit.
Once the user chooses execution, planning, exploration, or exit, gravity constraints are released.
This rule is non-negotiable.

3. Explicit Handoff Triggers
A handoff from Interruption UI → Main App UI occurs immediately when the user:
•	Starts an activity (“Start Activity”)
•	Plans an activity (“Plan for later”, “Save”)
•	Views statistics or insights
•	Opens Community (Friends, Discover, Upcoming)
•	Opens Settings or Account
•	Explicitly exits (“Ignore & Continue”)
At this moment:
•	Gravity rules stop applying
•	Main app interaction posture resumes

4. What MUST Stop at Handoff
Once a handoff occurs, the system must immediately stop:
•	Gravity-based layout constraints
•	Reduced choice enforcement
•	Soft containment language
•	Ethical friction mechanisms
•	Intervention-specific calm framing
Intervention UI must not “linger”.

5. What Is ALLOWED After Handoff
After handoff, the Main App may freely use:
•	Tabs and navigation bars
•	Dense information (charts, lists, stats)
•	Multiple CTAs
•	Planning and form-heavy screens
•	Social features
•	Normal product affordances
These are not considered manipulative outside the interruption context.
________________________________________
6. No Reverse Leakage Rule
Main App UI elements must never appear inside Interruption UI.
Forbidden inside Interruption UI:
•	Analytics
•	Metrics
•	Community feeds
•	Planning forms
•	Social comparison
•	Achievement framing
If such elements appear, the screen is mis-scoped.

7. Boundary Screen Rule
Screens that sit at the boundary (e.g. confirmations, exits):
•	May acknowledge progress
•	Must remain visually muted
•	Must not introduce reward framing
•	Must not gamify success
Once the next screen loads, the handoff is complete.

8. Design Reminder
BreakLoop intentionally has two interaction regimes:
•	One ethical, constrained, and protective
•	One capable, expressive, and functional
The handoff rule is what keeps both healthy.
