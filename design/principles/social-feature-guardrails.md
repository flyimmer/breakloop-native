# BreakLoop — Social Feature Guardrails  
**Phase E-1.5 (Revised)**

**Status:** Authoritative  
**Scope:** Messaging, User Profiles, Social Graphs, Notifications  
**Applies to:** All present and future social features  
**Precondition:** `main-app-posture.md` is authoritative

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines guardrails for social features in BreakLoop so that they:

- Enable real human coordination
- Support empathy and presence
- Encourage real-life connection
- Avoid moral pressure, comparison, or addictive dynamics

Social features are allowed and encouraged — **within these constraints**.

---

## 1. Core Law (Social Features)

> **Social features in BreakLoop exist to support real-world connection and coordination, not to evaluate, rank, or pressure users.**

---

## 2. Messaging Guardrails

### 2.1 Purpose of Messaging

Messaging exists to:
- Coordinate activities
- Clarify plans
- Enable human connection around real-life action

Messaging is allowed to be:
- Ongoing
- Human
- Emotional

It must not be optimized for:
- engagement maximization
- urgency
- response pressure

---

### 2.2 Notifications & Unread State

Messaging **may use notifications by default**.

Allowed:
- Push notifications
- Unread indicators
- Badge counts

Required constraints:
- Notifications must be **non-urgent in tone**
- No repeated escalation
- No guilt-based reminders
- No “nudge to reply” mechanics

Unread must indicate **state**, not **obligation**.

---

## 3. User Profile Guardrails

### 3.1 Purpose of Profiles

Profiles exist to:
- Provide human context
- Support trust and safety
- Help hosts decide on join requests
- Express personality and interests

Allowed profile elements:
- Profile photo(s)
- Self-introduction text
- Interests and preferences
- Recent or last activities
- Current activity (optional)

---

### 3.2 What Profiles Must Not Become

Profiles must not become:
- Performance dashboards
- Achievement showcases
- Moral comparisons

Forbidden:
- Scores
- Rankings
- Success rates
- Streaks
- Activity counts framed as “more / less”

The profile should answer:
> “Who is this person?”  
Not:
> “How good is this person?”

---

## 4. Mood & Activity Sharing

Mood sharing and current activity sharing are **explicitly allowed**.

Purpose:
- Enable empathy
- Encourage reaching out
- Support spontaneous real-life connection

Constraints:
- Must be opt-outable
- Must be ambient (not alarming)
- Must not be gamified or ranked

Mood is context, not content.

---

## 5. Social Graph Principles

- Friends are optional
- The app must work with zero friends
- Social discovery must not rely on existing social graphs

The community should feel:
- Open
- Horizontal
- Non-competitive

---

## 6. Discovery & Social Checking

Social checking is allowed and healthy **when it points to real-world action**.

Allowed:
- Browsing activities
- Seeing what friends are doing
- Discovering nearby events

Constraints:
- Feeds must be finite
- No infinite scroll
- No algorithmic engagement optimization
- Discovery should feel like a notice board, not a feed

Social browsing should invite action, not consumption.

---

## 7. Absence & Autonomy

- No penalties for not responding
- No negative signals for inactivity
- No social decay or loss framing

Social connection must remain voluntary.

---

## 8. Relationship to Main App Posture

This document specializes `main-app-posture.md`.

If there is a conflict:
- Main App Posture takes precedence
- Social features must be reduced, softened, or removed

---

## 9. Enforcement Questions

Any social feature must answer:
1. How does this support real-world connection?
2. What happens if the user ignores this for weeks?
3. Does this introduce pressure, comparison, or urgency?

If the answers are unsafe, the feature must be redesigned.

---

## 10. Phase E-1.5 Completion Statement

With these guardrails defined:

- Social features are enabled, not suppressed
- Human context is preserved
- Ethical boundaries remain intact

**Social features may now be designed responsibly.**
