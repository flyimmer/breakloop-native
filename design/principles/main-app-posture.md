# BreakLoop — Main App Posture  
**Phase E-1**

**Status:** Authoritative  
**Scope:** Main App (non-intervention)  
**Applies to:** Insights, Community, Settings, and all future main-app features  
**Does NOT apply to:** Intervention / Conscious Process flows

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines the **behavioral posture** of BreakLoop when the user is **not** in an intervention.

It exists to:
- Preserve ethical interruption principles outside vulnerable moments
- Prevent the main app from becoming another engagement-driven surface
- Constrain future features (e.g. messaging, profiles) before they exist

If a future feature conflicts with this document, **the feature is invalid**.

---

## 1. Core Posture (One-Sentence Law)

> **BreakLoop’s main app is a calm, reflective place that helps users notice patterns and coordinate real-world action — without pulling them back into the phone.**

This sentence is the primary design law for the main app.

---

## 2. Two Interaction Regimes (Boundary Reminder)

BreakLoop intentionally operates in two regimes:

### A. Intervention Regime (already locked)
- Vulnerable
- Time-pressured
- Ethically constrained
- Governed by `interaction-gravity.md`

### B. Main App Regime (this document)
- Non-urgent
- Retrospective or coordinative
- Low emotional pressure
- Never attention-seeking

**Rules from the intervention regime must not leak into the main app.**  
Likewise, main app richness must never appear inside intervention flows.

---

## 3. Emotional Temperature of the Main App

The main app must feel:

- Quiet  
- Unhurried  
- Non-evaluative  
- Ambiently supportive  

The user should feel:

> “I can come here when I want. Nothing bad happens if I don’t.”

If the app ever feels like:
- something to “check”
- something to “keep up with”
- something that might judge absence

→ this posture has been violated.

---

## 4. Legitimate User Intents

The main app exists to support **only three user intents**:

### 1. Reflection (Insights)
- Looking back over time
- Noticing patterns
- Understanding oneself without judgment

### 2. Coordination (Community)
- Planning activities
- Discovering activities happening nearby
- Joining or hosting real-world action

### 3. Configuration (Settings)
- Adjusting boundaries
- Expressing values
- Managing preferences and privacy

No fourth hidden intent (e.g. engagement, retention, habit reinforcement) is allowed.

---

## 5. What the Main App Must Never Do

The main app must never:

- Create urgency (“Don’t miss”, “Happening now”, countdown pressure)
- Evaluate behavior (“You failed”, “You improved”, grades, scores)
- Rank or compare users
- Reward frequency of app usage
- Replace boredom with scrolling
- Encourage “just checking”
- Penalize absence or inactivity

If a feature requires these dynamics to function, it does not belong in BreakLoop.

---

## 6. Insights Posture (Authoritative)

Insights are **descriptive, not prescriptive**.

They answer:
> “What patterns do I notice over time?”

They must not answer:
> “How well am I doing?”

### Allowed
- Aggregates and summaries
- Long-term trends
- Distributions and proportions
- Reflective language
- AI-assisted pattern interpretation

### Forbidden
- Scores, grades, streaks
- Success / failure framing
- Rankings or leaderboards
- Visual emphasis implying moral weight
- Language that implies obligation or judgment

Numbers may exist, but they must **describe**, not **evaluate**.

---

## 7. Community Posture (Authoritative)

Community is **coordination infrastructure**, not a social feed.

Its purpose is to:
- Make real-world action easier
- Surface opportunities for participation
- Support planning and presence

### Critical Rule
> **Community must not function as an emotional coping surface.**

This means:
- No infinite feeds
- No dopamine-driven discovery
- No social validation loops
- No pressure to browse when bored

Browsing may exist, but it must feel **finite**, not consumptive.

---

## 8. Absence Is Always Allowed (Non-Negotiable)

> **Nothing bad ever happens if the user does not open BreakLoop.**

There must be:
- No decay
- No loss
- No guilt
- No social penalty
- No “missed opportunity” framing

BreakLoop must be **safe to forget**.

---

## 9. Relationship to Future Features

This document intentionally precedes features such as:
- Messaging
- User profiles
- Social graphs
- Notifications

If added later, those features must:
- Remain ambient
- Avoid notification pressure by default
- Avoid performance or comparison displays
- Respect user absence
- Comply fully with this posture

This document is the constraint that prevents future scope from corrupting the product.

---

## 10. Relationship to Other Principles

- Intervention behavior is governed by `interaction-gravity.md`
- Transition boundaries are governed by `handoff-rules.md`
- This document governs **all non-intervention main app behavior**

---

## 11. Phase E-1 Completion Statement

With this posture defined:

- Phase D remains locked
- Main app behavior is ethically constrained
- Future feature work has clear boundaries

**Phase E-1 (Main App Posture) is complete.**

All main app screens must comply with `design/principles/main-app-posture.md`.
