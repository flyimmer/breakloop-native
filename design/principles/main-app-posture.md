# Main App Interaction Posture  
**BreakLoop — Phase C-2**

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines the **interaction posture** for the BreakLoop
Main App experience.

The Main App includes:
- Insights
- Community
- Planning
- Settings
- Retrospective views

This posture is intentionally **lighter** than interaction gravity.

The Main App is not an interruption.
It is an intentional, voluntary space.

---

## 1. Core Principle

> **The Main App must feel supportive, not directive.**

The app may inform, summarize, and offer options,
but it must never:
- pressure
- score
- reward
- shame
- compare

---

## 2. How the Main App Differs from the Conscious Process

| Conscious Process | Main App |
|------------------|---------|
| Vulnerable | Intentional |
| Time-sensitive | Self-paced |
| Ethically constrained | Informational |
| Gravity-driven | Navigation-driven |
| Minimal choice | Multiple paths allowed |

**Interaction gravity does NOT apply in the Main App.**

However, the Main App must still avoid manipulation.

---

## 3. General Posture Rules

The Main App should be:

- Calm
- Neutral
- Non-judgmental
- Non-gamified
- Non-competitive
- Optional

It should feel like:
> “A place to understand and organize,”  
not  
> “A place to perform or improve.”

---

## 4. Metrics & Insights Rules

Insights are retrospective, not evaluative.

Rules:
- No streak pressure
- No success/failure framing
- No red/green moral signaling
- No leaderboard or ranking language
- No time-based urgency

Metrics should answer:
- “What happened?”
- “What patterns exist?”

Not:
- “How good am I?”
- “Am I winning or losing?”

---

## 5. Community Rules

Community exists for:
- presence
- coordination
- mutual support

Not for:
- comparison
- competition
- status

Rules:
- No public performance metrics
- No social ranking
- No implicit pressure to join or host
- Participation is always optional and reversible

The Community should feel ambient, not demanding.

---

## 6. Planning & Creation (Plan Activity)

Planning and creation screens (e.g. “Plan an Activity”) are
**instrumental by nature**.

They are explicitly entered by the user and are not part of
self-regulation or interruption.

Posture:
- Clear
- Efficient
- Task-oriented
- Non-emotional

Rules:
- Strong affordances are allowed
- Forms may be dense if clarity improves
- Primary actions (“Save”, “Create”) should be obvious
- Validation and guidance are acceptable

However:
- No motivational language
- No moral framing (“good”, “bad”, “productive”)
- No emotional pressure
- No time urgency metaphors

Planning is logistics, not self-improvement.


---

## 7. Separation from the Conscious Process

Main App UI must not reuse:
- Intervention layouts
- Countdown metaphors
- Regulation language
- Gravity-based affordances

Likewise, intervention screens must not introduce:
- Metrics
- Community feeds
- Planning complexity

The handoff between regimes is explicit and intentional.

---

## 8. Non-Goals

The Main App does NOT aim to:
- Maximize engagement
- Increase daily usage
- Create habits inside the app
- Encourage frequent checking

BreakLoop exists to reduce compulsive behavior,
not replace it.

---

## 9. Review Requirement

Any new Main App screen should be answerable with:

- Is this informational or instrumental?
- Does this introduce pressure?
- Does this introduce comparison?
- Does this assume performance?

If yes to the last two, the screen needs revision.

---

## 10. Relationship to Native Work

This posture exists to:
- guide native translation
- prevent accidental gamification
- constrain AI-driven optimization

Native UI may be beautiful,
but posture must remain calm and neutral.
