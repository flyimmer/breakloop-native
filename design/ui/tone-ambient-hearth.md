# UI Tone: Ambient Hearth

## Core Intent
De-escalation through depth, softness, and shared ambient presence.
Nothing demands attention. Everything invites calm proximity.

---

## Hierarchy Rules
- Dominance is expressed via depth (elevation, glass), never contrast
- Primary focus elements may use elevation_2 or surfaceGlass
- Secondary content must visually recede (elevation_0–1)

Forbidden:
- Hard borders on primary content
- High-contrast color emphasis for importance

---

## Spacing Philosophy
- Vertical rhythm defaults to space_24 between major elements
- Space is treated as emotional buffer, not efficiency gap
- Dense stacking is forbidden in intervention and community screens

---

## Surface & Depth Rules
- Prefer surfaceSecondary + elevation over borders
- Glassmorphism is reserved for:
  - Intervention overlays
  - Context separation during urges
- radius_16 indicates “soft containment”
- radius_full indicates “human presence”

---

## Motion & Feedback
- All motion must feel like breathing, not counting
- Pulsing > ticking
- Fade / cross-dissolve preferred over slide for state changes

---

## Community-Specific Rules
- Presence is ambient, never foregrounded
- Avatars blend into cards; never float independently
- Chat bubbles must visually recede unless actively focused
- Status badges merge into surfaces, never overlay as stickers

---

## Emotional Guardrails
The UI must never:
- Create urgency
- Encourage comparison
- Reward speed or volume of interaction
